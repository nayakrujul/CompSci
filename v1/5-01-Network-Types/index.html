            A <strong>computer network</strong> refers to two or more computing devices connected together in order to share data and resources.
        </p>

        <p>Networks are grouped based on their size. There are three types of computer network.</p>

        <p class="definition">
            <img src="../icons/book.svg" class="icon" />
            A <strong>Local Area Network</strong> (LAN) covers a small geographical area located on a single site.
        </p>

        <p>
            LANs are often found in homes, schools, and small businesses. They can be wired, wireless, or a mix of both.
        </p>

        <p class="definition">
            <img src="../icons/book.svg" class="icon" />
            A <strong>Wide Area Network</strong> (WAN) connects LANs in multiple geographical areas.
        </p>

        <p>
            WANs are sometimes used by larger businesses with multiple offices. The biggest WAN in the world is the
            Internet, which is mostly made up of undersea fibre-optic cables. WANs are usually wired.
        </p>

        <p>WANs are typically slower than LANs and can be more open to an external attack.</p>

        <p class="definition">
            <img src="../icons/book.svg" class="icon" />
            A <strong>Personal Area Network</strong> (PAN) is a very small network centred around a single user.
        </p>

        <p>An example of a PAN is the Bluetooth connection between a mobile phone and some wireless headphones.</p>

        <p class="question">
            <img src="../icons/question.svg" class="icon" />
            What are the advantages and disadvantages of using computer networks?
        </p>

        <p class="spoiler noselect">
            <span class="default">Tap/click to reveal</span>
            <span class="answer">
                Advantages: <br />
                &bullet; Sharing files and resources (including devices like printers) across the network is a lot easier <br />
                &bullet; It is therefore easier to work collaboratively <br />
                &bullet; The computers can be centrally managed, so software can be updated remotely on all computers at once <br />
                &bullet; Accounts can be stored centrally, so users can log in from any device on the network <br /> <br />
                Disadvantages: <br />
                &bullet; Networks are often very expensive to set up because a lot of hardware is required <br />
                &bullet; Networks can be targeted by hackers, and malware can spread easily between devices on the same network <br />
                &bullet; There is potential for a single point of failure, meaning the network could go down if something breaks
