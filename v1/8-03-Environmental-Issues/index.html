            <strong>Environmental issues</strong> are about the impact on the natural world.
        </p>

        <p>Firstly, many computer parts contain <b>finite raw materials</b>:</p>

        <ul class="less-padding-left">
            <li>Hard Disk Drives contain <b>aluminium, steel,</b> and <b>platinum</b>.</li>
            <li>CPUs contain <b>fibreglass, copper,</b> and <b>gold</b>.</li>
            <li>Game controllers contain <b>plastic, rubber,</b> and <b>lithium</b>.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            Extracting these materials uses <b>lots of energy</b>, <b>creates pollution</b>, and <b>depletes scarce
            natural resources</b>.
        </p>

        <p><br />Here are some more environmental issues relating to <b>energy consumption</b>:</p>

        <ul class="less-padding-left">
            <li>
                All computing devices require energy, most of which is generated by burning fossil fuels, which
                <b>releases greenhouse gases</b> into the atmosphere, contributing to climate change.
            </li>
            <li>
                The Internet relies on servers in big data centres all around the world: it is estimated that these
                <b>data centers used around 300 billion kWh of energy</b> in 2022.
            </li>
            <li>
                With technology becoming more and more prevalent in our everyday lives, <b>this figure is only going to
                grow</b> over the new few years.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <p>Here are some issues about <b>E-waste</b>:</p>
        
        <ul class="less-padding-left">
            <li>
                Modern devices have a very short lifetime, and so <b>20-50 million tonnes of E-waste</b> is created each
                year.
            </li>
            <li>
                Many manufacturers often <b>discourage users from keeping their old devices</b> by making them less
                repairable.
            </li>
            <li>
                Also, many older devices can be <b>hard to recycle</b> because of problems like explosive lithium
                batteries.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <p class="question">
            <img src="../icons/question.svg" class="icon" />
            A lot of E-waste also ends up in landfill in poorer countries. What is the impact of this?
        </p>

        <p class="spoiler noselect">

            <span class="answer">
                Toxic chemicals from the E-waste can leak into groundwater and harm wildlife.
            </span>
