                Application software is designed to help the user perform specific end-user tasks. &check; <br />

            Explain two benefits of embedded systems over general-purpose systems. [4]

            <span class="answer">
                Any two benefits stated and explained from: <br />
                - They are cheaper to produce &check; <br />
                &ensp; because most of their memory is ROM, which is cheaper than RAM. &check; <br />
                - They are more reliable &check; <br />
                &ensp; because they have less code, and so usually have less bugs. &check; <br />
                - They are more energy-efficient &check; <br />
                &ensp; because they don't need to perform as many tasks. &check;

        <p class="question">

            <span class="answer">
                Cache stores regularly used data and instructions, &check; <br />
                which can be accessed by the CPU faster than from RAM. &check;
            </span>

            <span class="answer">
                NOTE: reject the words "fetch", "decode", and "execute" in explanations. <br />
                You are NOT allowed to describe the stages using these words in an exam. <br />
                <br /> Fetch (max. 2 marks): <br />
                - The next instruction is retrieved from main memory &check; <br />
                - and placed into the Instruction Register in the CPU. &check; <br />
                - The Program Counter register is incremented. &check; <br />
                <br /> Decode (max. 1 mark): <br />
                - The CPU splits the instruction up, &check; <br />
                - and works out what needs to be done. &check; <br />
                <br /> Execute (max. 2 marks): <br />
                - The instruction is carried out by the CPU. &check; <br />
                - Main memory may be updated in the process. &check; <br />
                - Data may be sent to and from the ALU in order to carry out the instruction. &check; <br />

        <p class="question">
            <img src="../icons/question.svg" class="icon" />
            Compare the RAM and ROM requirements in an embedded system and a general-purpose system. [4]
        </p>

        <p class="spoiler noselect">
            <span class="default">Tap/click to reveal</span>
            <span class="answer">
                In an embedded system there is more ROM than RAM &check; <br />
                because the software does not need to be changed (it is hard-coded) &check; <br />
                In a general-purpose system there is more RAM than ROM &check; <br />
                because the software is replaceable and is thus programs are run from RAM &check;

            <span class="answer">
                Flash storage &check; <br />
                because it is the most resistant to impacts &check; <br />

            A company stores all of their file backups on magnetic tape. Discuss the advantages and disadvantages of
            switching to cloud storage. [6]

            <span class="answer">
                At least three advantages and three disadvantages required for full marks. <br />
                <br /> Advantages: <br />
                - The backups can be accessed from any internet-connected device &check; <br />
                - It is easy to increase the amount of available storage. &check; <br />

                - The backups will be safe in the event of a fire at the company's building &check; <br />
                <br /> Disadvantages: <br />
                - An internet connection would be required to access the files &check; <br />
                - The firm is dependent on the host company to manage the security &check; <br />
                - Using cloud storage might be against data protection laws &check; <br />
                - Subscription fees may be expensive in the long term &check;

                - Memory Management &check; <br />
                &ensp; The OS manages which sections of RAM each application can control. &check; <br />
                - I/O Device Management &check; <br />
                &ensp; The OS communicates with input/output devices connected to the computer. &check; <br />
                - Application Management &check; <br />
                &ensp; The OS provides an interface through which applications can be accessed. &check; <br />
                - Disk Management &check; <br />
                &ensp; The OS keeps track of where each file is stored in secondary storage. &check; <br />
                - Security Management &check; <br />
