            <strong>Legal issues</strong> are about what is deemed right and wrong by the law.
        </p>

        <p>
            The <b>Data Protection Act 2018</b> (the UK version of GDPR, the General Data Protection Regulation) governs
            data collection, processing, and storage:
        </p>

        <ul class="less-padding-left">
            <li>
                Organisations must <b>only collect data for a specific purpose</b> and also make sure that the data is
                accurate.
            </li>
            <li>
                Data must <b>only be processed with the user's consent</b>, if there is a legal obligation to do so, or
                other legitimate reasons.
            </li>
            <li>
                Also, the data must <b>not be kept longer than necessary</b> or transferred to other countries unless
                they can keep it protected.
            </li>
            <li>
                The data must <b>be protected from unauthorised access</b>, but in the event of a data breach, the
                customers must be told within 72 hours.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <p>It also provides a number of rights for the customer, including:</p>

        <ul class="less-padding-left">
            <li>The right to <b>view data stored about you</b> by an organisation for free.</li>
            <li>The right to <b>withdraw consent</b> (e.g. from mailing lists).</li>
            <li>The right to <b>make changes to your data</b> if it is inaccurate.</li>
            <li>The right to <b>delete all your personal data</b> from an organisation's servers.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            <b>GDPR is being enforced.</b> Meta was fined €1.2bn (£1bn) in Ireland for transferring data to the United
            States without enough data protection mechanisms in May 2023.
        </p>

        <p><br />The <b>Computer Misuse Act 1990</b> introduced four new offences:</p>

        <ul class="less-padding-left">
            <li>
                <b>Making, supplying, or obtaining malware</b> which could be used to commit the following crimes
                (maximum 2 years in prison).
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Unauthorised access to computer material</b>, like logging in to a network with someone else's
                details (maximum 2 years in prison).
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Unauthorised modification of computer material</b>: deleting or changing files that are not your own
                (maximum 2 years in prison).
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Unauthorised access in order to commit a crime</b>, like stealing data or destroying a network
                (maximum 5 or 10 years in prison, depending on the crime).
            </li>
        </ul>

        <p><br />The <b>Copyright, Designs and Patents Act 1988</b> protects creations from being copied:</p>

        <ul class="less-padding-left">
            <li>
                If you invent something and receive a patent, this Act <b>prevents anyone else from using the
                invention</b> without your permission for 20 years.
            </li>
            <li>
                If you write a book, create a video, compose some music, or make a piece of software, this Act <b>lets
                you decide how your work should be used</b> for 70 years, or until your death.
            </li>
            <li>
                Copyright infringement <b>can result in fines or up to 10 years in prison</b>.
            </li>
        </ul>
