        <p>
            In this section, we will be looking at the <b>ethical, legal, and environmental impacts</b> of technology.
            This is the broadest section in the course, and the list of issues here is <b>by no means exhaustive</b>.
            It is probable that you will get a 9-mark question on this section asking you to <b>"Discuss the ethical /
            legal / environmental impacts of <i>x</i>"</b>, where <i>x</i> might be something like "autonomous
            vehicles". In that case, you can use what is written on these pages, but you can also use your own
            knowledge as well. <b>You will get marks for any relevant points</b>, as long as they are fully explained.
        </p>

            <strong>Ethical issues</strong> are about what is considered right and wrong by society.
        </p>

        <p>Here are some general ethical issues of technology:</p>

        <ul class="less-padding-left">
            <li>
                Smartphones may have made us <b>more anti-social</b> as we spend more time communicating through screens
                instead of talking face-to-face.
            </li>
            <li>
                People can now be tracked through their devices, leading to many <b>privacy issues</b>.
            </li>
            <li>
                There is also a greater opportunity for <b>identity theft</b>, given that we post so much personal
                information online.
            </li>
            <li>
                Robots are now <b>reducing the demand for lower-skilled jobs</b>, like moving boxes at Amazon fulfilment
                centres.
            </li>
            <li>
                Unequal access to technology has <b>increased the inequality</b> between richer and poorer nations.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <p>Here are some ethical issues related to autonomous vehicles:</p>

        <ul class="less-padding-left">
            <li>
                Many taxi drivers may <b>lose their jobs</b> as autonomous vehicles become more and more popular.
            </li>
            <li>
                If there is a crash, <b>who is at fault</b>? The company? The programmer? The passenger?
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Who should the program prioritise</b> if it has to make a choice between saving two people's lives?
            </li>
        </ul>

        <p>Here are some ethical issues related to the Internet:</p>

        <ul class="less-padding-left">
            <li>
                People now have greater anonymity, which can enable <b>anti-social behaviour</b>.
            </li>
            <li>
                For example, <b>cyber-bullying</b> is when someone uses the Internet to insult someone.
            </li>
            <li>
                Organisations now <b>store a lot of our personal data</b> because of the Internet, and this can be
                hacked into and leaked.
            </li>
            <li>
                The Internet has enabled fraudsters to set up scams such as <b>pharming sites</b>, which we discussed in
                Section 6.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <p>Here are some ethical issues related to surveillance and censorship:</p>

        <ul class="less-padding-left">
            <li>
                Government security services may be <b>monitoring internet traffic</b> to look for keywords alerting
                them to illegal activities, which some people say is an infringement of privacy,
            </li>
            <li>
                In some countries, Internet Service Providers are <b>legally required to share their customers' internet
                history</b> wth security services.
            </li>
            <li>
                Many governments also use some form of <b>censorship</b>, usually to protect children from inappropriate
                sites, but this is a controversial topic.
            </li>
        </ul>

                There are privacy issues, as a lot of information may be extracted from your brain.
