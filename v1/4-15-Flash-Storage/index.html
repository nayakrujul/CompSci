            <strong>Solid State Drives</strong> (SSDs) are the main form of flash storage in computers.
        </p>

        <p>They use electrical currents to represent 1s and 0s.</p>

        <p><br />
            SSDs have significantly faster read/write times than HDDs. They are also more robust because they have no
            moving parts.
        </p>

        <p>However, SSDs are more expensive than HDDs (&approx;10p per GB), and they have a slightly lower capacity.</p>

        <p>
            Also, flash storage degrades over time, as it only has a limited number of read/write cycles, meaning that
            SSDs are less reliable than HDDs.
        </p>

        <p><br />Other types of flash storage include USB sticks and SD cards.</p>

            Would an SSD need defragmentation?
        </p>

        <p class="spoiler noselect">

            <span class="answer">
                No, because it takes the same amount of time to read from or write to any memory location on an SSD.
                HDDs need defragmentation because of the spinning disks: data in adjacent sectors can be read more
                quickly than data in far away sectors.
