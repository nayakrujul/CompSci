            <strong>Cloud Storage</strong> is a service where files can be uploaded via the Internet to a remote server.
        </p>

        <p>The data is then stored on HDDs and SSDs in data centres all around the world.</p>

        <p><b><br />The advantages of Cloud Storage include:</b></p>

        <ul class="spaced-out less-padding-left">
            <li>
                Files and applications <b>can be accessed from any Internet-connected device</b> anywhere in the world.
            </li>
            <li>
                Files stored in the cloud <b>can be shared easily</b>, often by just sending someone a link to the file.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Working with other people is easier</b> when the files are stored in the Cloud.
            </li>
            <li>
                There is <b>no need to buy potentially expensive hardware</b> to store the data yourself.
            </li>
            <li>
                There is <b>no need for a company to hire IT staff</b> to manage the hardware.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Security and backup is managed by the host company</b> so you don't need to worry about it.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <p><b><br />The disadvantages of Cloud Storage include:</b></p>

        <ul class="spaced-out less-padding-left">
            <li>
                An <b>Internet connection is required</b> to access the files.
            </li>
            <li>
                You are <b>dependent on the host company</b> to manage the security and backup of your files properly.
            </li>
            <li>
                Cloud data <b>could be targeted by hackers</b> more easily than locally-stored data.
            </li>
            <li>
                There is <b>no need to buy potentially expensive hardware</b> to store the data yourself.
            </li>
            <li>
                It is <b>unclear who legally owns the data</b> that is stored on the cloud.
            </li>
            <li>
                Ongoing <b>subscription fees</b> may become expensive in the long term.

            Would it be wise for classified documents to be stored on the Cloud?

            <span class="answer">
                No: Cloud Storage servers are often targeted by hackers, and it may be unclear who legally owns the
                data, which is not good for classified documents.
