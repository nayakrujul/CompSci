        <p>On this page we're going to look at how data is actually sent across a network.</p>

        <p class="definition">
            <img src="../icons/book.svg" class="icon" />
            A <strong>protocol</strong> is a set of rules that defines how devices on a network communicate with each other.
        </p>

        <p>The protocols involved in sending data across networks can be grouped into <b>"layers"</b>.</p>

        <p>Table 1 shows the protocol layers.</p>

            </tr>
        </table>

        <br />

        <p>
            When data is being sent, it starts at the application layer and makes its way down to the link layer. When
            data is being received, it starts at the link layer and makes its way up to the application layer.
        </p>

        <p><br />Now, let's examine each protocol in detail. <br /> &nbsp;</p>

        <p class="definition">
            <img src="../icons/book.svg" class="icon" />
            The <strong>Transmission Control Protocol</strong> (TCP) operates at the transport layer.
        </p>

        <p>Firstly, it establishes a connection between the sending and receiving devices.</p>
        
        <p>Then, it splits the data into numbered "packets" (smaller bits of data).</p>

        <p>
            It communicates with the receiving device to make sure all the packets have arrived. If not, they are
            re-sent.
        </p>

        <p>It then reassembles the packets into the right order on the receiving device.</p>

        <p>The sending device gets confirmation when the transfer is complete. <br /> &nbsp;</p>

        <p class="definition">
            <img src="../icons/book.svg" class="icon" />
            The <strong>User Datagram Protocol</strong> (UDP) also operates at the transport layer.
        </p>

        <p>Just like TCP, it establishes a connection between the two devices and splits the data up into packets.</p>

        <p>However, unlike TCP, it does not check if the packets have been received.</p>

        <p>
            This makes UDP a lot faster than TCP, which is good for uses such as live streaming, however it is not very
            good for anything else because some data might be missing. <br /> &nbsp;
        </p>

        <p class="definition">
            <img src="../icons/book.svg" class="icon" />
            The <strong>Internet Protocol</strong> (IP) operates at the internet layer.
        </p>

        <p>
            You have probably heard of IP addresses before. These are unique numbers assigned to every device on a
            network.
        </p>

        <p>
            The IP addresses of the sender and recipient are attached by the Internet Protocol to each data packet
            before it is sent.
        </p>

        <p>Then, IP directs directs the data packets across networks in a process known as packet switching.</p>

        <p>
            Each packet is sent between a series of routers: each router reads the packet's destination IP address and
            decides where to send it next. <br /> &nbsp;
        </p>

        <p class="definition">
            <img src="../icons/book.svg" class="icon" />
            The <strong>HyperText Transfer Protocol</strong> (HTTP) operates at the application layer.
        </p>

        <p>
            It manages the transmission of data between a web server and a client (browser), providing a way for users
            to interact with webpages.
        </p>

        <p>
            HyperText Transfer Protocol Secure (<b>HTTPS</b>) is an extension to HTTP that encrypts communications
            between the web server and the client, meaning that it is not possible for data to be stolen.
        </p>

        <p>Your browser used HTTPS to load this page onto your device. <br /> &nbsp;</p>

        <p class="definition">
            <img src="../icons/book.svg" class="icon" />
            The <strong>File Transfer Protocol</strong> (FTP) also operates at the application layer.
        </p>

        <p>
            It allows users to transfer files between client and server computers. Servers can accept connections from
            multiple clients simultaneously and limit file access to authenticated users or provide anonymous access to
            any connected user. <br /> &nbsp;
        </p>

        <p class="definition">
            <img src="../icons/book.svg" class="icon" />
            The <strong>Simple Mail Transfer Protocol</strong> (SMTP) operates at the application layer.
        </p>

        <p>
            It controls the transmission of email messages from a user's email client to their mail server, and from one
            user's mail server to another, using a process called "store and forward". Messages are then stored on the
            recipient's mail server, waiting to be downloaded via IMAP. <br /> &nbsp;
        </p>

        <p class="definition">
            <img src="../icons/book.svg" class="icon" />
            The <strong>Internet Messaging Access Protocol</strong> (IMAP) also operates at the application layer.
        </p>

        <p>
            It allows email client applications to interact with mail servers, providing users with the option to
            download and read their messages, delete messages, and organise messages within folders. Changes (including
            whether a message is read or not) are synchronised with the server, providing consistency across all of a
            user's devices. <br /> &nbsp;
        </p>

        <p class="definition">
            <img src="../icons/book.svg" class="icon" />
            <strong>Wi-Fi</strong> is a family of related protocols which operate at the link layer.
        </p>

        <p>It controls the physical transmission of data as radio waves.</p>

        <p>
            It uses two radio frequency bands: 2.4GHz (which has a greater range and is better at getting through walls)
            and 5GHz (which is faster over shorter distances). <br /> &nbsp;
        </p>

        <p class="definition">
            <img src="../icons/book.svg" class="icon" />
            <strong>Ethernet</strong> is also a family of related protocols which operate at the link layer.
        </p>

        <p>It controls the physical transmission of data as electrical currents.</p>

        <p>While Wi-Fi is specifically for wireless connections, Ethernet is specifically for wired connections.</p>

        <p class="question">
            <img src="../icons/question.svg" class="icon" />
            IPv4 is the most common type of IP address. It is essentially a 32-bit number. How many unique IPv4 addresses are there?
        </p>

        <p class="spoiler noselect">
            <span class="default">Tap/click to reveal</span>
            <span class="answer">
                <code>2<sup>32</sup></code> &approx; 4.3 billion unique IPv4 addresses. This might sound like a lot, but
                we're actually running out of them. To solve this, many devices now use IPv6, which are 128-bit numbers.
                There are over 300 undecillion (3 followed by 38 zeros) unique IPv6 addresses.
            </span>
