        <p>Despite their many advantages, networks can pose a security risk to organisations.</p>

        <p>
            Data can be stolen or leaked by either outsiders ("<b>hackers</b>") or insiders (in what's known as an
            "<b>insider attack</b>"). Organisations must protect against this because of legal requirements, and
            possible reputational damage.
        </p>

        <p>
            Multiple security methods can be used together in order to protect networks against these threats. <br />
            &nbsp;
        </p>

        <p class="definition">
            <img src="../icons/book.svg" class="icon" />
            <strong>Authentication</strong> systems determine who you are and what you can access.
        </p>

        <p>Methods of authentication include:</p>

        <ul class="less-padding-left">
            <li>Username and password combinations</li>
            <li>Biometric authentication (like facial recognition)</li>
            <li>Physical access keys (like USB dongles)</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            Once you have been authenticated, user access levels are used to determine what files, applications and
            resources you can access on the network. For example, some files on a school network might be only for
            teachers. User access levels would determine who can access these files and who should be restricted.
        </p>

        <p>To keep your passwords secure, you should:</p>

        <ul class="less-padding-left">
            <li>Use strong passwords (numbers, letters, and symbols; at least 8 characters long)</li>
            <li>Use a different password for each website</li>
            <li>Change your passwords regularly</li>
            <li>Never share your password with anyone</li>
            <li>Use a password manager</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            To clear any confusion: hacking a password manager will <b>NOT</b> give you someone's passwords, as the
            passwords are encrypted. You will get the useless ciphertext version of their passwords. We'll learn more
            about encryption right now &darr; <br /> &nbsp;
        </p>

        <p class="definition">
            <img src="../icons/book.svg" class="icon" />
            <strong>Encryption</strong> provides protection against data being read if it is stolen or intercepted.
        </p>

        <p>
            Encryption cannot stop data from being stolen or intercepted: it just makes the stolen data useless to the
            hacker.
        </p>

        <p>
            Encryption algorithms convert the original <b>plaintext</b> data into the encrypted <b>ciphertext</b> data.
            A password (called a "<b>key</b>") is needed to decrypt the ciphertext back into the plaintext.
        </p>

        <p>
            Unless a hacker also steals the key (which is pretty much impossible), they can't decrypt the data. <br />
            &nbsp;
        </p>

        <p class="definition">
            <img src="../icons/book.svg" class="icon" />
            <strong>Firewalls</strong> are devices that act as barriers between the network and the outside world.
        </p>

        <p>
            They inspect both incoming and outgoing packets, and aim to stop hackers and malware getting into the
            network, as well as packets from spyware going out of the network.
        </p>

        <p>
            Note that firewalls can only reduce the likelihood of unauthorised access and that they do not directly
            protect against either the spread of malware within a network or the risk of downloading malware from
            external sources (like websites).
        </p>

        <p>This means that a firewall will not prevent you from downloading a virus from the internet. <br /> &nbsp;</p>

        <p class="definition">
            <img src="../icons/book.svg" class="icon" />
            <strong>MAC Address Filtering</strong> limits network access to only whitelisted devices.
        </p>

        <p>
            Each device has a unique <b>Media Access Control (MAC) address</b> on its Network Interface Card. The MAC
            addresses of accepted devices are whitelisted (allowlisted?) on the switch or Wireless Access Point. If a
            device has a MAC address which is not on the whitelist, it will be denied access to the network.
        </p>

        <p>
            However, it does not identify who is using the device: just because a device is authenticated doesn't mean
            the user of that device is trustworthy. Also you can "spoof" (fake) a MAC address to join a network.
        </p>

            <img src="../icons/question.svg" class="icon" />
            What are the advantages and disadvantages of biometric authentication methods?
        </p>

        <p class="spoiler noselect">
            <span class="default">Tap/click to reveal</span>
            <span class="answer">
                Advantages: <br />
                &bullet; It is impossible to forget your access credentials <br />
                &bullet; Biometric authentication is often much faster than other methods <br />
                &bullet; The access credentials cannot be (easily) stolen <br /> <br />
                Disadvantages: <br />
                &bullet; Biometric authentication often requires expensive hardware <br />
                &bullet; There is a much higher rate of false positives in biometric authentication
