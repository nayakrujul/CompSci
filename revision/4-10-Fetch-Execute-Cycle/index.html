            The <strong>Fetch-Execute Cycle</strong> (sometimes called the Fetch-Decode-Execute Cycle) describes how a CPU carries out instructions
        </p>

        <p>The cycle consists of three stages:</p>

        <ul class="spaced-out less-padding-left">
            <li>
                The <b>Fetch</b> Stage <br />
                The next instruction is loaded from main memory into the Instruction Register in the CPU. The Program
                Counter (the register that stores what memory address the next instruction is at) is incremented to
                point to the next instruction. 
            </li>

            <li>
                The <b>Decode</b> Stage <br />
                The CPU works out what needs to be done in order to carry out the instruction.
            </li>

            <li>
                The <b>Execute</b> Stage <br />
                The operation is carried out by the CPU. If necessary, data is sent between the CU and the ALU. Data may
                be written to or read from main memory. Any relevant registers are updated.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <p><br />Then, the cycle starts again. Each stage takes exactly one clock tick.</p>

        <br />

        <p class="question">
            <img src="../icons/question.svg" class="icon" />
            How will the clock speed of a CPU affect its performance?
        </p>

        <p class="spoiler noselect">
            <span class="default">Tap/click to reveal</span>
            <span class="answer">
                If the clock speed is higher, the Fetch-Execute Cycle takes less time and therefore the CPU performs
                better. However, increasing the clock speed above the recommended level is called "overclocking" -
                which could be dangerous for your computer.
