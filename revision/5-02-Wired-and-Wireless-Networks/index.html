        <p>
            Networks can be either wired or wireless. Specialised network hardware is required to create both types of
            networks.

            A <strong>Network Interface Card</strong> (NIC) is a piece of hardware inside a device that allows it to connect to networks.
        </p>

        <p>NICs exist for both wired and wireless networks.</p>

            A <strong>router</strong> transmits data between different LANs.

            A <strong>switch</strong> is a component of a wired LAN which sends data packets to devices on its network.
        </p>

        <p class="definition">

            A <strong>Wireless Access Point</strong> is essentially a switch for a wireless network.
        </p>

        <p>
            The acronym "WAP" is sometimes used in place of "Wireless Access Point", although we will refrain from using
            the short form version in this revision guide.
        </p>

        <p><br />
            Fun fact: your home broadband router is actually also acting as a switch and a Wireless Access Point.
        </p>

        <p><br />
            There are two types of <b>cable</b> used to transmit data in wired networks: copper wires and fibre-optic
            cables.
        </p>

        <p>Table 1 shows the comparison of copper wires and fibre-optic cables.</p>

            A <strong>Wireless LAN</strong> (WLAN) is a local wireless network.
        </p>

        <p>Wi-Fi, the most well-known example of a wireless network, is a specific family of WLAN protocols.</p>

        <p><br />Wireless networks use <b>radio waves or microwaves</b> to transmit data.</p>

        <p class="question">
            <img src="../icons/question.svg" class="icon" />
            What are the advantages and disadvantages of wireless networks?
        </p>

            <span class="answer">
                Advantages: <br />
                &bullet; Wireless networks can be more convenient because you can move around while connected <br />
                &bullet; New devices can be easily added to a wireless network at no extra cost <br /> <br />
                Disadvantages: <br />
                &bullet; Wireless communications can be intercepted by hackers so they are less secure <br />
                &bullet; Wireless networks are more susceptible to interference from nearby networks <br />
                &bullet; Radio waves can be blocked by physical obstacles which can reduce signal strength <br />
                &bullet; Wireless networks typically offer lower bandwidth and therefore lower data transfer speeds
