            A <strong>penetration test</strong> is an authorised attempt to gain access to a network without the normal means of access.
        </p>

        <p>
            Essentially, a penetration test is conducted by an ethical ("white-hat") hacker mimicking what an actual
            ("black-hat") hacker would do in order to get into the network. This is done in order to test the security
            of the network.
        </p>

        <p>
            Some penetration tests will also test an organisation's staff to see how likely they are to fall for social
            engineering (see 6.03) tricks.
        </p>

        <p><br />There are two types of penetration tests:</p>

        <p class="definition">
            <img src="../icons/book.svg" class="icon" />
            In a <strong>black-box penetration test</strong>, the ethical hackers are given no information at all about the network.
        </p>

        <p>
            The objective is to see how much damage an external hacker could do to the network. The test initially
            involves looking for a way into the network.
        </p>

        <p class="definition">
            <img src="../icons/book.svg" class="icon" />
            In a <strong>white-box penetration test</strong>, the ethical hackers are given some knowledge about the network.
        </p>

        <p>
            This could potentially include IP addresses or even login credentials. The objective is to see how much
            damage a malicious insider (someone already on the network) could do to the network.

        <p class="question">
            <img src="../icons/question.svg" class="icon" />
            Why should an organisation perform a penetration test?
        </p>

            <span class="answer">
                To avoid data breaches, test security controls, and ensure that the organisation isn't at risk of
                breaking the law.
            </span>
