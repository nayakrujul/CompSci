            <strong>Secondary Storage</strong> is non-volatile storage which isn't directly accessible by the CPU.
        </p>

        <p>
            There are three forms of secondary storage: <b>magnetic, flash,</b> and <b>optical,</b> all of which will be
            covered over the next three pages.
        </p>

        <p class="definition">

            <strong>Hard Disk Drives</strong> (HDDs) are the main form of magnetic storage in computers.
        </p>

        <p>
            They are made up of magnetised metal disks, called <b>"platters"</b>, spinning at a rate of around 10,000
            revolutions per minute.
        </p>

        <p>
            Binary data is represented by the direction of magnetisation (North is 1 and South is 0).
        </p>

        <p>Each platter is divided into <b>"tracks"</b>, and each track into <b>"sectors"</b>.</p>

        <p>There is a read/write head, like the needle on an old record player.</p>

        <p class="question">
            <img src="../icons/question.svg" class="icon" />
            What are the advantages and disadvantages of using HDDs?
        </p>

            <span class="answer">
                HDDs offer very large storage capacities (several terabytes), and are also very cheap (&lt;5p per GB).
                However, because of their moving parts, HDDs can be damaged by large impacts like drops.
