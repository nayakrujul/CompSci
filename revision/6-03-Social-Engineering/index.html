            <strong>Social engineering</strong> is the art of manipulating people so that they divulge confidential information.
        </p>

        <p>
            Often, no matter how much is spent on sophisticated technical protection such as firewalls, it is <b>people
            who are the weak point</b>.
        </p>

        <p class="definition">
            <img src="../icons/book.svg" class="icon" />
            <strong>Blagging</strong> (or pretexting) refers to using an invented scenario to increase the chances of the victim divulging information.
        </p>

        <p>
            This could include impersonating an employee of a company, posing as a delivery person, or pretending that
            they're in trouble and need money.
        </p>

        <p class="definition">
            <img src="../icons/book.svg" class="icon" />
            <strong>Phishing</strong> is the technique of fraudulently obtaining private information, often via email or SMS.
        </p>

        <p>Phishing attacks will often convince people to click on links in order to obtain their personal details.</p>

        <p class="definition">
            <img src="../icons/book.svg" class="icon" />
            <strong>Pharming</strong> means creating fake versions of websites where victims enter their details.
        </p>

        <p>
            This is the most common form of phishing attack. Many pharming attacks will use fake versions of banks or
            online shops like Amazon.
        </p>

        <p><br />Phishing attempts often contain a number of clues:</p>

        <ul class="less-padding-left">
            <li>They are typically addressed to generic recipients such as "Dear Sir/Madam" or "Dear user".</li>
            <li>They contain links and threats of consequences.</li>
            <li>There might be spelling and grammar mistakes.</li>
            <li>The sender's email address might not be from an official domain.</li>
        </ul>

        <p class="definition">
            <img src="../icons/book.svg" class="icon" />
            <strong>Shouldering</strong> is the way of obtaining someone's private information (PIN, password, etc.) by looking while they enter it.
        </p>

        <p>
            Unlike other forms of social engineering, shouldering requires close physical proximity to the victim and
            can therefore not be carried out remotely.
        </p>
