            <strong>Hardware</strong> is the physical components of a computer system.
        </p>

        <p>This includes the screen, CPU, keyboard and mouse, RAM, and speakers.</p>

        <p class="definition">

            A <strong>general purpose system</strong> is a computer system which can perform many tasks and has replaceable software.
        </p>

        <p>For example, the device that you're viewing this page on (or any other phone, tablet, laptop or desktop).</p>

            An <strong>embedded system</strong> is a computer system which is built into another device to perform a specific task.
        </p>

        <p>There are embedded systems in washing machines, dishwashers and microwaves. Embedded systems have their software (called <b>"firmware"</b>) hard-coded onto their chip, so their instructions cannot be changed.</p>

        <p class="question">
            <img src="../icons/question.svg" class="icon" />
            What are the advantages and disadvantages of embedded systems?
        </p>

            <span class="default">Tap/click to reveal</span>
            <span class="answer">
                Embedded systems are very reliable, cheap to mass produce, and energy efficient. However, they are difficult to update if a bug is discovered.
