            The <strong>clock speed</strong> of a CPU is the number of pulses sent out by the clock every second.
        </p>

        <p>
            It is typically measured in gigahertz (GHz). 1GHz is 1 billion cycles per second. Most CPUs nowadays have
            clock speeds between 3 and 5 GHz.
        </p>

        <p>
            If the clock speed is higher, the Fetch-Execute Cycle takes less time and therefore the CPU performs
            better.
        </p>

            <strong>CPU cores</strong> have their own CU, ALU and cache.
        </p>

        <p>
            Most CPUs have multiple cores (usually between 8 and 16), meaning they can process multiple instructions in
            parallel. However, this is only useful if there are multiple tasks running on your computer.

            <strong>Cache</strong> memory is very fast memory located within the CPU.
        </p>

        <p>
            Having more cache memory reduces the time it takes for the CPU to retrieve data and instructions, therefore
            making the CPU perform better. However, cache is very expensive.

        <p class="question">
            <img src="../icons/question.svg" class="icon" />
            How many times more RAM than cache do you think a typical computer has?
        </p>

        <p class="spoiler noselect">
            <span class="default">Tap/click to reveal</span>
            <span class="answer">
                A typical computer will have around 16GB of RAM, and around 100MB of cache overall. Note that 16GB is
                equal to 16000MB, so the answer is about 160 times more.
