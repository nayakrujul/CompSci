                The <strong>Fetch-Execute Cycle</strong> (also called the Fetch-Decode-Execute Cycle) is the sequence of operations that the CPU uses to carry out instructions.
            </p>

            <p>
                The cycle consists of three stages:
            </p>

            <ul class="less-padding-left spaced-out">
                <br />
                <li>
                    The <b>Fetch</b> stage <br /> &nbsp;
                    <ol class="less-padding-left">
                        <li>
                            The <b>memory address of the next instruction</b> is copied from the Program Counter (PC)
                            into the <b>Memory Address Register (MAR)</b>.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            This address is <b>sent along the address bus</b> to main memory, and the instruction at that
                            memory location is <b>sent back along the data bus</b> into the Memory Buffer Register (MBR).
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            The contents of the MBR are <b>copied into the Current Instruction Register (CIR)</b>. 
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            The <b>PC is incremented</b> to point to the next instruction.
                        </li>
                    </ol>
                </li>
                <li>
                    The <b>Decode</b> stage <br /> &nbsp;
                    <ol class="less-padding-left" start="5">
                        <li>
                            The Control Unit (CU) splits the instruction into its <b>opcode</b> and <b>operand(s)</b>
                            where relevant, and the <b>required operation is identified</b>.
                        </li>
                    </ol>
                </li>
                <li>
                    The <b>Execute</b> stage <br /> &nbsp;
                    <ol class="less-padding-left" start="6">
                        <li>
                            The CU <b>sends control signals</b> to other CPU components (e.g. the ALU).
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            The instruction is <b>carried out</b>. Data may be read from or written to memory, and
                            <b>registers</b> (including the PC and Status Register) <b>may be updated</b>.
                        </li>
                    </ol>
                </li>
            </ul>

            <p>
                An <b>interrupt</b> is a signal sent by a device or program that <b>requires immediate attention</b>
                from the CPU. It allows the <b>currently running process to be suspended</b>, and then resumed after the
                interrupt request has been dealt with.
            </p>

            <p>
                At the end of each Fetch-Decode-Execute cycle, the CPU <b>checks for interrupt requests</b>. If it has
                received one, it <b>saves the current state of the registers</b> in memory (to allow the registers to be
                used to handle the interrupt) and then calls an <b>Interrupt Service Routine</b> (ISR) to handle the
                request. After it has finished, the registers are repopulated with the original data and the cycle restarts.
            </p>

                Give some examples of when interrupts would be required.

                    For example, an input from a peripheral (e.g. keypress or mouse move), a hardware fault such as a
                    power failure, software interrupts from the Operating System, or exception interrupts (e.g. divide-by-zero).
