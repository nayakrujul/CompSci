            <p>There are two main types of designs of computer systems.</p>

            <p class="definition">

                In the <strong>von Neumann architecture</strong>, data and program instructions are stored together in a single pool of main memory.
            </p>

            <p class="definition">
                <img src="../../icons/book.svg" class="icon" />
                In the <strong>Harvard architecture</strong>, data and instructions are stored separately in two distinct memory spaces.
            </p>

            <p>
                The von Neumann architecture is used in <b>all modern general-purpose devices</b> due to its flexibility,
                while <b>embedded systems</b> might use the Harvard architecture due to its ability to access data and
                instructions in parallel. The Harvard architecture can also <b>prevent data from being executed as
                code</b> (an exploit that could be used by hackers).
            </p>

            <br />

            <p>
                The <b>stored program concept</b> is the idea that instructions can be stored in and fetched from main
                memory, just like data. This allows for <b>different programs to be run</b> without changing the hardware.
            </p>

            <p class="question">
                <img src="../../icons/question.svg" class="icon" />
                How does the stored program concept relate to the von Neumann architecture?
            </p>
    
            <p class="summary-question">
                <span class="answer">
                    The stored program concept is the basis of the von Neumann architecture, where data and program
                    instructions are stored together in main memory and transmitted along the same buses.
