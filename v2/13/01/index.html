            <p><br />All computer systems require certain <b>essential components</b>.</p>

            <p class="definition">
                <img src="../../icons/book.svg" class="icon" />
                The <strong>processor</strong> or Central Processing Unit (CPU) executes machine code instructions to run programs.
            </p>

            <p>This will be explored further later on in this section.</p>
            
            <br />

            <p class="definition">
                <img src="../../icons/book.svg" class="icon" />
                <strong>Main memory</strong> stores data and program instructions so that they can be fetched by the processor.
            </p>

            <p>
                Main memory is <b>split into small blocks</b> (usually bytes), each of which has an <b>address</b> that
                can be used to retrieve the data in that space.
            </p>
            
            <br />

            <p class="definition">
                <img src="../../icons/book.svg" class="icon" />
                <strong>Buses</strong> are collections of wires used to send data between components of the computer system.
            </p>

            <p>The three main buses are:</p>

            <ul class="less-padding-left spaced-out">
                <li>
                    The <b>data bus</b>, a bidirectional bus which carries data between the CPU and other components such as main memory
                </li>
                <li>
                    The <b>address bus</b>, a unidirectional bus which transfers memory addresses from the CPU to other components
                </li>
                <li>
                    The <b>control bus</b>, a bidirectional bus carrying signals such as the clock and read/write mode
                </li>
            </ul>

            <p>
                The <b>width</b> of a bus is the number of wires that it has. Since each wire can transmit a single bit
                of information at once, the <b>total number of memory locations</b> that can be transmitted by the
                address bus is <code>2<sup>w</sup></code>, where <code>w</code> is the width of the bus.
            </p>

            <br />

            <p class="definition">
                <img src="../../icons/book.svg" class="icon" />
                <strong>Input/Output controllers</strong> are hardware components that manage communication between the processor and external devices.
            </p>

            <p>
                They include a <b>port</b> to connect to the peripheral device, a set of <b>registers</b> to hold data,
                and an <b>interface</b> to connect to the processor.
            </p>

            <p class="question">
                <img src="../../icons/question.svg" class="icon" />
                What is the minimum required address bus width to address 16GB of RAM, where each memory location is a byte?
            </p>
    
            <p class="summary-question">
                <span class="answer">
                    16GB is equal to 16,000,000,000 bytes. Taking <code>log<sub>2</sub></code> of this gives <code>33.9</code>,
                    so the minimum width required is 34.
