                <strong>Secondary storage</strong> is non-volatile storage which isn't directly accessible by the CPU.
            </p>

            <p>
                Computer systems need secondary storage, as <b>RAM is volatile</b> (so can't be used for long-term
                storage) and <b>ROM is read-only</b>.
            </p>

            <p>
                There are three types of secondary storage: <b>magnetic</b>, <b>flash</b> and <b>optical</b>.
            </p>

            <br />

                <strong>Hard Disk Drives</strong> (HDDs) are the most common form of magnetic storage in computers.
            </p>

            <p>
                HDDs use <b>magnetised regions</b> on metal discs called <b>platters</b> to store binary data. These
                platters spin at up to 10,000 revolutions per minute. Each platter is divided into <b>tracks</b> and
                <b>sectors</b>, which allows the physical location of the data to be identified. A <b>magnetic arm</b>
                is moved across the platter to <b>read or write data</b>.
            </p>

            <p>
                Hard disks offer <b>high capacity</b> and <b>low cost-per-GB</b>, however they can be <b>damaged by
                large impacts</b> as they contain moving parts.
            </p>

            <br />

                <strong>Solid State Drives</strong> (SSDs) are the most common form of flash storage in computers.
            </p>

            <p>
                They use <b>NAND flash memory cells</b> to store data using <b>electrical charges</b>. Cells are
                arranged into <b>pages</b>, and pages are arranged into <b>blocks</b>. The <b>controller chip</b>
                manages the reading and writing of data: data is <b>written in pages</b> but <b>erased in blocks</b>.
            </p>

            <p>
                SSDs offer <b>faster transfer speeds</b> and <b>lower latency</b> than HDDs, as well as being <b>more
                robust</b> as they have no moving parts. This makes them <b>ideal for portable devices</b> like laptops
                and mobile phones. However, they can be <b>more expensive</b>. Also, NAND memory degrades over time,
                meaning that SSDs have a <b>limited number of read/write cycles</b> before they become unreliable.
            </p>

                <strong>Optical Storage</strong> uses indentations on the surface of a disc to represent binary data.
            </p>

            <p>
                To read the disc, a reader <b>shines laser light at the surface</b> as the disc spins. The intensity of
                reflected light is then measured to detect the <b>pits</b> and <b>lands</b>, which are then converted
                into binary.
            </p>

            <p>
                The three main types of optical storage are <b>CDs</b> (which hold around 700MB of data, ideal for
                <b>audio files</b>), <b>DVDs</b> (which hold around 4.7GB of data, ideal for <b>movies</b>), and
                <b>Blu-ray discs</b> (which hold around 25GB of data, ideal for <b>software</b> such as large games).
            </p>

            <p>
                Each type comes in three different formats: <b>ROM</b> (read-only memory: data on the disc cannot be
                changed), <b>R</b> (recordable: data can be written once and then can't be changed), and <b>RW</b>
                (rewritable: data can be rewritten multiple times).
            </p>

            <p>
                While optical storage is <b>very cheap and portable</b>, it has a <b>low capacity and slow read/write
                speeds</b>. Discs can also be <b>easily damaged</b> by scratches.
            </p>

            <p class="question">
                <img src="../../icons/question.svg" class="icon" />
                Which type of optical storage disc is the most suitable for 4K video distribution?
            </p>
    
            <p class="summary-question">
                <span class="answer">
                    Blu-ray ROM, as CDs and DVDs will not have sufficient capacity for large 4K
                    video files, and the video does not need to be rewritten.
                </span>
