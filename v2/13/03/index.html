            <p><br /><b>Processors</b> consist of a number of components:</p>

            <ul class="spaced-out less-padding-left">
                <li>
                    The <b>Control Unit</b> (CU) coordinates the activities of the CPU, <b>identifying the processes</b>
                    needed to carry out each instruction and <b>sending control signals</b> to the appropriate components.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The <b>Arithmetic and Logic Unit</b> (ALU) performs <b>mathematical</b> (addition/subtraction),
                    <b>logical</b> (<code>AND</code>, <code>OR</code>, <code>XOR</code>, <code>NOT</code>) and
                    <b>bit-shift</b> operations.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The <b>clock</b> which generates an <b>oscillating signal</b> to synchronise the activity of CPU components.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>General-purpose registers</b> are small units of memory in the CPU that can store anything,
                    usually an <b>intermediate result</b> of a calculation or a <b>memory address</b>.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>Dedicated registers</b> (or special-purpose registers) are used to hold <b>specific values</b>
                    needed by the CPU. They include: <br /> &nbsp;
                    <ul class="less-padding-left spaced-out">
                        <li>
                            The <b>Program Counter</b> (PC), which holds the <b>memory address of the next instruction</b> 
                            to be executed. It is updated at the end of the Fetch stage of the Fetch-Decode-Execute cycle.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            The <b>Current Instruction Register</b> (CIR), which <b>holds the current instruction</b>
                            which is to be decoded and executed.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            The <b>Memory Address Register</b> (MAR), which holds the <b>memory address</b> of data
                            which is to be read from or written to main memory.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            The <b>Memory Buffer Register</b> (MBR), which holds the <b>actual data</b> which has been
                            read from or is to be written to main memory.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            The <b>Status Register</b> (SR), which holds <b>status codes</b> relating to the executed
                            instruction (e.g. if an overflow has occurred during a calculation).
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>

            <p>
                Some processors can also include some <b>cache memory</b>, which is very fast memory inside the CPU. It
                stores <b>recently and frequently used</b> instructions and data so that they don't need to be fetched
                from main memory if needed again.
            </p>

            <p class="question">
                <img src="../../icons/question.svg" class="icon" />
                How could CPU performance be affected by amount of cache memory? What about other factors?
            </p>
    
            <p class="summary-question">
                <span class="answer">
                    &bullet; More cache memory means more instructions and data can be retrieved faster, which improves CPU performance <br />
                    &bullet; Having multiple CPU cores can also improve performance if tasks can be performed in parallel <br />
                    &bullet; Increasing the clock speed will mean more Fetch-Execute cycles in a second, which improves performance <br />
                    &bullet; A higher word size (the number of bits the CPU can process at once) will also improve CPU performance <br />
                    &bullet; Increasing the width of the address bus will also improve performance, as more memory locations can be addressed <br />
                    &bullet; Similarly, increasing the width of the data bus will also improve performance, as more data can be sent at once <br />
                </span>
