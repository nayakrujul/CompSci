                A <strong>barcode</strong> is a black-and-white image that represents some data in a machine-readable format.
            </p>

            <p>
                There are two types of barcodes: <b>one-dimensional</b> (commonly used to represent product ID numbers)
                and <b>two-dimensional</b> (such as <b>Quick Response (QR) codes</b>, used to represent anything from
                plane tickets to URLs).
            </p>

            <p>Diagram 1 shows an example of each type of barcode..</p>

                Diagram 1 <br /> <br />
                <img src="./barcodes.png" style="width: 500px;" />
            </p>

            <p>
                One-dimensional barcode readers work by <b>moving a laser or LED light source</b> across the barcode. A
                <b>light sensor</b> then measures the <b>intensity of reflected light</b> to work out if the bar was
                black or white. The bars are then <b>converted into binary</b> and sent to the computer.
            </p>

            <p>
                Two-dimensional barcodes can be read using <b>charge-coupled device (CCD)</b>-based readers (using an
                <b>array of light sensors</b> instead of only one, and with no moving beam) or <b>digital cameras</b>
                (e.g. in your smartphone).
            </p>

            <p>
                Using barcodes <b>speeds up data entry and reduces human error</b>. Barcode readers are also <b>very
                cheap</b> and can be <b>easily integrated</b> into most computer systems (the reader can send data as
                keyboard inputs).
            </p>

            <br />

                A <strong>digital camera</strong> is an input device that captures photographs, representing them as binary data.
            </p>

            <p>
                Light enters through the lens of the camera and is <b>focused on the sensor</b>. A <b>colour filter
                array</b> is placed above the sensor, which allows half of the pixels to detect green light, a quarter
                to detect red light, and a quarter to detect blue light. Each pixel <b>produces an electrical current</b>
                based on the light intensity received. This is converted into a digital signal using an
                <b>analogue-to-digital converter</b>, and the output is stored as a bitmap image.
            </p>

                <strong>Radio Frequency Identification</strong> (RFID) is a technology used to identify and track objects wirelessly using radio waves.
            </p>

            <p>
                An RFID reader <b>emits radio waves</b>, generating an electromagnetic field. The RFID tag then <b>sends
                its unique identifier</b> back to the reader. The reader converts the signal into digital data.
            </p>

            <p>
                The tags can be <b>active</b> (they have their own battery) or <b>passive</b> (they are powered by the
                incoming radio waves).
            </p>

            <p>
                RFID can be used for <b>fast, automated data capture</b>. An advantage is that <b>no line-of-sight is
                required</b>, and the <b>range is much longer</b> than barcodes. However, they are more expensive.
            </p>

                A <strong>laser printer</strong> is an output device that forms images on paper using powdered toner.
            </p>

            <p>
                First, the <b>cylindrical drum</b> inside the printer is <b>charged</b>. Then, a laser <b>draws the
                inverse of the image</b> onto the drum, causing those areas to lose their charge. The <b>powdered toner
                particles</b> (which are oppositely charged to the drum) are brought near the drum, and are <b>attracted
                to the charged areas</b> (i.e. the areas not hit by the laser), which forms an image on the drum. This
                is then <b>transferred onto paper</b> and fused by heated rollers.
            </p>

            <p>
                For colour printers, this process is <b>repeated four times</b> (once for each colour of toner: cyan,
                magenta, yellow and black).
            </p>

                What are the advantages and disadvantages of laser printers compared with traditional inkjet printers?
            </p>
    
            <p class="summary-question">
                <span class="answer">
                    Advantages: <br />
                    &bullet; Laser printers are faster than inkjet printers <br />
                    &bullet; Toner is cheaper than ink, so laser printers have a lower cost per page <br />
                    &bullet; Toner does not dry out, whereas ink does <br />
                    <br />
                    Disadvantages: <br />
                    &bullet; Laser printers have a higher upfront cost than inkjet printers <br />
                    &bullet; Laser printers also use more power than inkjet printers <br />
                    &bullet; Laser printers are larger and heavier than inkjet printers
