                <strong>Environmental issues</strong> are about the impact on the natural world.
            </p>
    
            <p>Firstly, many computer parts contain <b>finite raw materials</b>:</p>
    
            <ul class="spaced-out less-padding-left">
                <li>Hard Disk Drives contain <b>aluminium, steel,</b> and <b>platinum</b>.</li>
                <li>CPUs contain <b>fibreglass, copper,</b> and <b>gold</b>.</li>
                <li>Game controllers contain <b>plastic, rubber,</b> and <b>lithium</b>.</li>
            </ul>
    
            <p>
                Extracting these materials uses <b>lots of energy</b>, <b>creates pollution</b>, and <b>depletes scarce
                natural resources</b>.
            </p>
    
            <p><br />Here are some more environmental issues relating to <b>energy consumption</b>:</p>
    
            <ul class="spaced-out less-padding-left">
                <li>
                    All computing devices require energy, most of which is generated by burning fossil fuels, which
                    <b>releases greenhouse gases</b> into the atmosphere, contributing to climate change.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The Internet relies on servers in big data centres all around the world: it is estimated that these
                    <b>data centers used around 300 billion kWh of energy</b> in 2022.
                </li>
                <li>
                    With technology becoming more and more prevalent in our everyday lives, <b>this figure is only going to
                    grow</b> over the new few years.
                </li>
            </ul>
    
            <p>Here are some issues about <b>E-waste</b>:</p>
            
            <ul class="spaced-out less-padding-left">
                <li>
                    Modern devices have a very short lifetime, and so <b>20-50 million tonnes of E-waste</b> is created each
                    year.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Many manufacturers often <b>discourage users from keeping their old devices</b> by making them less
                    repairable.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Also, many older devices can be <b>hard to recycle</b> because of problems like explosive lithium
                    batteries.
                </li>
            </ul>

            <br />
    
            <hr />
    
            <p class="question">
                <img src="../../icons/question.svg" class="icon" />
                A lot of E-waste also ends up in landfill in poorer countries. What is the impact of this?
            </p>
    
            <p class="summary-question">
                <span class="answer">
                    Toxic chemicals from the E-waste can leak into groundwater and harm wildlife.
                </span>
            </p>
