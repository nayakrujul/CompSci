                <strong>Legal issues</strong> are about what is deemed right and wrong by the law.
            </p>
    
            <p>
                The <b>Data Protection Act 2018</b> (the UK version of GDPR, the General Data Protection Regulation) governs
                data collection, processing, and storage:
            </p>
    
            <ul class="spaced-out less-padding-left">
                <li>
                    Organisations must <b>only collect data for a specific purpose</b> and also make sure that the data is
                    accurate.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Data must <b>only be processed with the user's consent</b>, if there is a legal obligation to do so, or
                    other legitimate reasons.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Also, the data must <b>not be kept longer than necessary</b> or transferred to other countries unless
                    they can keep it protected.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The data must <b>be protected from unauthorised access</b>, but in the event of a data breach, the
                    customers must be told within 72 hours.
                </li>
            </ul>
    
            <p>It also provides a number of rights for the customer, including:</p>
    
            <ul class="spaced-out less-padding-left">
                <li>The right to <b>view data stored about you</b> by an organisation for free.</li>
                <li>The right to <b>withdraw consent</b> (e.g. from mailing lists).</li>
                <li>The right to <b>make changes to your data</b> if it is inaccurate.</li>
                <li>The right to <b>delete all your personal data</b> from an organisation's servers.</li>
            </ul>
    
            <p>
                GDPR is being enforced. Meta was fined €1.2bn (£1bn) in Ireland for transferring data to the United
                States without enough data protection mechanisms in May 2023.
            </p>
    
            <p><br />The <b>Computer Misuse Act 1990</b> introduced four new offences:</p>
    
            <ul class="spaced-out less-padding-left">
                <li>
                    <b>Making, supplying, or obtaining malware</b> which could be used to commit the following crimes
                    (maximum 2 years in prison).
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>Unauthorised access to computer material</b>, like logging in to a network with someone else's
                    details (maximum 2 years in prison).
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>Unauthorised modification of computer material</b>: deleting or changing files that are not your own
                    (maximum 2 years in prison).
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>Unauthorised access in order to commit a crime</b>, like stealing data or destroying a network
                    (maximum 5 or 10 years in prison, depending on the crime).
                </li>
            </ul>
    
            <p><br />The <b>Copyright, Designs and Patents Act 1988</b> protects creations from being copied:</p>
    
            <ul class="spaced-out less-padding-left">
                <li>
                    If you invent something and receive a patent, this Act <b>prevents anyone else from using the
                    invention</b> without your permission for 20 years.
                </li>
                <li>
                    If you write a book, create a video, compose some music, or make a piece of software, this Act <b>lets
                    you decide how your work should be used</b> for 70 years, or until your death.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Copyright infringement <b>can result in fines or up to 10 years in prison</b>.
                </li>

                An employee of a web design company has lost his job and is very upset. Before he leaves, he does the following actions:

                    <li>Logs in to a computer with a colleague's username and password</li>
                    <li>Copies logos and other graphics from there onto his USB stick</li>
                    <li>Downloads a list of all the company's clients and their contact details</li>
