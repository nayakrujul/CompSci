                In this section, we will be looking at the <b>ethical, legal, and environmental impacts</b> of technology.
                This is the broadest section in the course, and the list of issues here is <b>by no means exhaustive</b>.
                It is probable that you will get a 9-mark question on this section asking you to <b>"Discuss the ethical /
                legal / environmental impacts of <i>x</i>"</b>, where <i>x</i> might be something like "autonomous
                vehicles". In that case, you can use what is written on these pages, but you can also use your own
                knowledge as well. <b>You will get marks for any relevant points</b>, as long as they are fully explained.
            </p>

                <strong>Ethical issues</strong> are about what is considered right and wrong by society.
            </p>
    
            <p>Here are some general ethical issues of technology:</p>
    
            <ul class="spaced-out less-padding-left">
                <li>
                    Smartphones may have made us <b>more anti-social</b> as we spend more time communicating through screens
                    instead of talking face-to-face.
                </li>
                <li>
                    People can now be tracked through their devices, leading to many <b>privacy issues</b>.
                </li>
                <li>
                    There is also a greater opportunity for <b>identity theft</b>, given that we post so much personal
                    information online.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Robots are now <b>reducing the demand for lower-skilled jobs</b>, like moving boxes at Amazon fulfilment
                    centres.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Unequal access to technology has <b>increased the inequality</b> between richer and poorer nations.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Electronic devices contain rare materials like gold and lithium, which are often extracted using
                    <b>child labour</b> in lower income countries.
                </li>
            </ul>
    
            <p>Here are some ethical issues related to autonomous vehicles:</p>
    
            <ul class="spaced-out less-padding-left">
                <li>
                    Many taxi drivers may <b>lose their jobs</b> as autonomous vehicles become more and more popular.
                </li>
                <li>
                    If there is a crash, <b>who is at fault</b>? The company? The programmer? The passenger?
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>Who should the program prioritise</b> if it has to make a choice between saving two people's lives?
                </li>
            </ul>
    
            <p>Here are some ethical issues related to the Internet:</p>
    
            <ul class="spaced-out less-padding-left">
                <li>
                    People now have greater anonymity, which can enable <b>anti-social behaviour</b>.
                </li>
                <li>
                    For example, <b>cyber-bullying</b> is when someone uses the Internet to insult someone.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Organisations now <b>store a lot of our personal data</b> because of the Internet, and this can be
                    hacked into and leaked.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The Internet has enabled fraudsters to set up scams such as <b>pharming sites</b>, which we discussed in
                    Section 6.
                </li>
            </ul>
    
            <p>Here are some ethical issues related to surveillance and censorship:</p>
    
            <ul class="spaced-out less-padding-left">
                <li>
                    Government security services may be <b>monitoring internet traffic</b> to look for keywords alerting
                    them to illegal activities, which some people say is an infringement of privacy,
                </li>
                <li>
                    In some countries, Internet Service Providers are <b>legally required to share their customers' internet
                    history</b> wth security services.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Many governments also use some form of <b>censorship</b>, usually to protect children from inappropriate
                    sites, but this is a controversial topic.
                </li>
            </ul>

                What are the possible ethical issues of brain implants?

            <p class="summary-question">
                <span class="answer">
                    There are privacy issues, as a lot of information may be extracted from your brain.
