                <strong>Serial transmission</strong> is where one bit is sent at a time.
            </p>

            <p>
                Serial transmission uses a <b>single wire</b> to send data <b>one bit at a time</b>.
            </p>

            <p>Diagram 1 shows an example of serial transmission.</p>

                <strong>Parallel transmission</strong> is where multiple bits are sent at once.
            </p>

            <p>
                Parallel transmission uses <b>multiple wires</b> to send <b>a lot of data simultaneously</b>.
                This seems better than serial transmission, but in reality <b>it's a lot worse</b>:
            </p>

            <ul class="spaced-out less-padding-left">
                <li>
                    In a perfect world data from all channels <b>would be perfectly synchronised</b> so that they are
                    all <b>sent at exactly the same time</b>. In reality however, there is a <b>delay between the clock
                    and each data channel</b>, meaning that it is <b>difficult to synchronise</b> parallel transmission
                    at higher bit rates.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Also, <b>imperfections in the wires</b> used to transmit the data could mean that the <b>data isn't
                    received at the same time</b> (because data in some wires travels faster than data in other wires),
                    which causes a <b>delay at the receiving end</b>. This is called <b>data skew</b>.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>Crosstalk (interference) between wires</b> can also be an issue over longer distances, resulting
                    in <b>corrupted data</b>, making parallel transmission <b>less reliable</b> than serial transmission.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Also, the <b>extra wiring required</b> for parallel transmission makes it <b>more expensive</b> than
                    serial transmission.
                </li>
            </ul>

            <p>
                Therefore, serial transmission is <b>cheaper, faster, and more reliable</b> than parallel transmission.
            </p>

            <p class="question">
                <img src="../../icons/question.svg" class="icon" />
                Where might parallel data transmission be used instead of serial transmission?
            </p>
    
            <p class="summary-question">
                <span class="answer">
                    Over short distances, such as the control buses inside a computer, because the effects of data skew
                    are negligible.
