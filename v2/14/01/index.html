                <strong>Communication</strong> is the process of transferring information from one party to another, via some communication medium.
            </p>

            <p>
                This medium is usually some kind of <b>cable for a wired connection</b>, or <b>the air for a wireless
                connection</b>.
            </p>

            <p class="definition">
                <img src="../../icons/book.svg" class="icon" />
                The <strong>bit rate</strong> measures the speed of communication, i.e. how much data can be sent every second.
            </p>

            <p>
                The bit rate is measured in <b>bits per second</b> (bps), <b>kilobits per second</b> (kbps), or
                <b>megabits per second</b> (Mbps).
            </p>

            <p class="definition">
                <img src="../../icons/book.svg" class="icon" />
                The <strong>Baud rate</strong> measures how many changes can be made to a signal every second.
            </p>

            <p>
                The Baud rate is measured in <b>Bauds</b> or <b>changes per second</b>. But how is it different from the
                bit rate?
            </p>

            <p><br />Diagram 1 shows an example of a digital signal used to transmit information.</p>

            <p class="diagram">
                <img src="../../icons/image.svg" class="icon" />
                Diagram 1 <br /> <br />
                <img src="./diagram1.png" width="500px" />
            </p>

            <p>
                Here, <b>20 bits</b> have been transferred in <b>0.05 seconds</b> (50ms), and so the bit rate is
                <b>400 bps</b>. However, there can only be a maximum of <b>10 signal changes</b> in that same time
                period, so the Baud rate is <b>200 changes/sec</b>.
            </p>

            <p>
                In general, <code class="no-underline"><b>bit rate</b> (bps) = <b>Baud rate</b> (changes/sec) &times;
                <b>bits per signal</b> (bits)</code>. <br /> &nbsp;
            </p>

                <strong>Bandwidth</strong> (in the context of communication) is the range of frequencies which can be used in a medium.
            </p>

            <p>
                That means that bandwidth is equal to the <b>highest possible frequency</b> minus the <b>lowest possible
                frequency</b> that can be transmitted in a certain medium. Because <b>bandwidth is directly proportional
                to bit rate</b>, a <b>higher bandwidth</b> means a <b>higher bit rate</b>.
            </p>

                <strong>Latency</strong> is the time delay between a signal being sent and received.
            </p>

            <p>
                Note that latency is <b>unrelated to bit rate</b>. It is possible to have a <b>high bit rate</b> (a lot
                of data sent every second) with a <b>high latency</b> (the data takes a long time to get to the receiver).
            </p>

                Calculate the bit rate of a communication that has a Baud rate of 3 MegaBaud and 16 possible voltage levels.
            </p>
    
            <p class="summary-question">
                <span class="answer">
                    16 voltage levels means 4 bits per signal (because 2<sup>4</sup> = 16). Therefore 
                    <code>bit rate = 3,000,000 &times; 4 = 12Mbps</code>.
