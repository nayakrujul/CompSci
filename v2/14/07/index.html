                <strong>Carrier Sense Multiple Access with Collision Avoidance</strong> (CSMA/CA) is a protocol used in wireless networks in order to prevent data collisions.
            </p>

            <p>
                Before a <b>device attempts to transmit information</b> on the network, it first listens for
                signals to check if <b>another device is currently transmitting</b>. If the <b>network is idle</b>
                (no other devices transmitting), then it <b>starts transmitting</b>. It then <b>waits for an
                acknowledgement signal</b> from the router to verify that the data was received correctly.
                If the network wasn't idle, the device <b>waits a random period of time</b> before trying again.
            </p>

            <p><br />
                This works if every device on the network is <b>in range of every other device's transmissions</b>, but
                this is often not the case. For example, consider the setup shown in Diagram 1 below. If <b>A wants to
                transmit</b> while <b>B is already transmitting</b>, A will not know that B is transmitting, because
                it is <b>out of range</b>. This is called the <b>"hidden node problem"</b>.
            </p>

            <p><br />
                Diagram 1 shows a network with two devices, A and B. The dashed outlines show the range of each device's
                transmissions.
            </p>

                <strong>Request to Send and Clear to Send</strong> (RTS/CTS) is a protocol that can be optionally used alongside CSMA/CA which helps solve the hidden node problem.
            </p>

            <p>
                Before a device attempts to transmit information, it sends a short <b>Request to Send (RTS) message</b>
                to the wireless access point. If no other devices are transmitting, the wireless access point returns a
                <b>Clear to Send (CTS) message</b>, telling the device to start the transmission. All other devices on
                the network <b>go silent for some time</b> after hearing the CTS message. When they <b>hear the
                acknowledgement message</b>, the other devices know that the transmission is over, and they can attempt
                to <b>transmit their own message</b> again.
