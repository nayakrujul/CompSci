            <p>We know these two definitions from GCSE:</p>

            <p class="definition">
                <img src="../../icons/book.svg" class="icon">
                <strong>Hardware</strong> is the physical components of a computer system.
            </p>

            <p class="definition">
                <img src="../../icons/book.svg" class="icon">
                <strong>Software</strong> refers to the programs or instructions that control a computer's hardware.
            </p>

            <p><br />Software can be broadly classified into <b>two different groups</b>:</p>

            <p class="definition">
                <img src="../../icons/book.svg" class="icon" />
                <strong>Application software</strong> means programs which perform end-user tasks.
            </p>

            <p>Within application software there are <b>three main categories</b>:</p>
            <ul class="less-padding-left spaced-out">
                <li><b>General-purpose</b>: used for many different purposes, like <b>word processors</b> and <b>web browsers</b></li>
                <li><b>Special-purpose</b>: for one specific task, like <b>a music player</b></li>
                <li><b>Bespoke</b>: custom-built for an organisation or individual</li>
            </ul>
    
            <p class="definition">
                <img src="../../icons/book.svg" class="icon" />
                <strong>System software</strong> means programs which are needed for the computer to function.
            </p>

            <p>This consists of:</p>
            <ul class="less-padding-left spaced-out">
                <li><b>Operating Systems</b>, which provide an interface between application software and the computer's hardware</li>
                <li><b>Utility programs</b>, which perform maintenance tasks like defragmentation and virus scanning</li>
                <li><b>Libraries</b>, which are collections of reusable code that other programs can use</li>
                <li><b>Translators</b>, which convert high-level code into low-level machine code that can be executed by the computer</li>
            </ul>

            <p>We'll learn more about these types of system software over the next few pages.</p>

            <p class="question">
                <img src="../../icons/question.svg" class="icon" />
                What are the advantages and disadvantages of bespoke software over "off-the-shelf" (general- and special-purpose) software?
            </p>
    
            <p class="summary-question">
                <span class="answer">
                    Advantages: <br />
                    &bullet; Features are exactly as the customer requires, with nothing missing or unnecessary <br />
                    &bullet; The client will have greater control over updates to the program <br />
                    &bullet; Can provide an edge over competitors as they don't have access to the same software <br />
                    <br />
                    Disadvantages: <br />
                    &bullet; More expensive due to development costs <br />
                    &bullet; Will not be available immediately <br />
                    &bullet; Less likely to have as much support and maintenance as off-the-shelf software
                </span>
