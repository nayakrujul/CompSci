                Networks can be either wired or wireless. <b>Specialised network hardware</b> is required to create both
                types of networks.

                A <strong>Network Interface Card</strong> (NIC) is a piece of hardware inside a device that allows it to connect to networks.
            </p>
    
            <p>NICs exist for <b>both wired and wireless</b> networks.</p>

                A <strong>router</strong> transmits data between different LANs.

                A <strong>switch</strong> is a component of a wired LAN which sends data packets to devices on its network.

                A <strong>Wireless Access Point</strong> is essentially a switch for a wireless network.
            </p>
    
            <p>
                The acronym <b>"WAP"</b> is sometimes used in place of "Wireless Access Point", although we will refrain from using
                the short form version in this revision guide.
            </p>
    
            <p><br />
                Fun fact: your home broadband router is actually <b>also acting as a switch and a Wireless Access Point</b>.

                There are two types of <b>cable</b> used to transmit data in wired networks:
                <b>copper</b> wires and <b>fibre-optic</b> cables.
            </p>
    
            <p>Table 1 shows the comparison of copper wires and fibre-optic cables.</p>

                A <strong>Wireless LAN</strong> (WLAN) is a local wireless network.
            </p>
    
            <p><b>Wi-Fi</b>, the most well-known example of a wireless network, is a specific <b>family of WLAN protocols</b>.</p>
    
            <p><br />Wireless networks use <b>radio waves or microwaves</b> to transmit data.</p>

                What are the advantages and disadvantages of wireless networks?
            </p>
    
            <p class="summary-question">
                <span class="answer">
                    Advantages: <br />
                    &bullet; Wireless networks can be more convenient because you can move around while connected <br />
                    &bullet; New devices can be easily added to a wireless network at no extra cost <br /> <br />
                    Disadvantages: <br />
                    &bullet; Wireless communications can be intercepted by hackers so they are less secure <br />
                    &bullet; Wireless networks are more susceptible to interference from nearby networks <br />
                    &bullet; Radio waves can be blocked by physical obstacles which can reduce signal strength <br />
                    &bullet; Wireless networks typically offer lower bandwidth and therefore lower data transfer speeds
