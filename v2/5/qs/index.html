                        Three marks available per layer. In each layer: detailed description scores 3; some description scores 2; statements made scores 1. <br /> <br />


                        Example of detailed description [3]: <br />

                        HTTPS is an extension of HTTP and allows secure transfer of data between a
                        browser and a website by encrypting data. The web browser will check the website
                        server's security certificate and ensure it is legitimate. This means it's not possible to
                        see or eavesdrop on what you're browsing or for your data to be stolen. <br /> <br />


                        Example of some description [2]: <br />
                        
                        HTTPS allows secure transfer of data between a browser and a website by
                        encrypting the data being transferred to stop your data being stolen. It does this by
                        checking a security certificate to see if the website is legitimate. <br /> <br />


                        Example of statements [1]: <br />

                        In HTTPS the S stands for secure and stops your data being stolen on a website. It
                        encrypts your data. <br /> <br />

                        <br />

                        Indicative content: <br /> <br />

                        HTTP <br />
                        Provides a way for users to interact with web resources. Transmits messages between client and server
                        using hypertext. <br /> <br />

                        HTTPS <br />
                        As HTTP but in addition uses an encryption protocol to ensure communications are secure. <br /> <br />

                        SMTP <br />
                        Enables users to send (and receive) email messages. Initiates sessions between user and mail server.
                        Server then forwards messages. Uses a process called 'store and forward' to store messages and forward
                        as necessary. The server decides which server to send the message to and the inbox provider then
                        downloads the message and places it in the recipient's inbox. Often used in conjunction with IMAP. <br /> <br />

                        IMAP <br />
                        Stores email messages on an ISPs server but allows user to manipulate messages as though on a local
                        device. Local devices access the ISP server to access the messages. IMAP works with desktop clients and
                        webmail clients. Allows simultaneous logins from different devices to one account. <br /> <br />

                        FTP <br />
                        Allows secure transfer of files between client and server. Files are uploaded to and downloaded from the
                        server using FTP. <br /> <br />

                        TCP <br />
                        Connects network devices to the Internet. It defines how applications can create channels of
                        communication across a network. It manages how a message is assembled into smaller packets before
                        transmission and reassembles packets in the correct order at destination. <br /> <br />

                        UDP <br />
                        Communications protocol that establishes low latency and loss-tolerating connections between
                        applications. Enables the transfer of data before an agreement is provided by the receiving party. This
                        speeds up transfers. Can start transferring data before agreement is received from receiving party. <br /> <br />

                        IP <br />
                        Relays data across network boundaries. It defines how to address and route each packet to make sure it
                        reaches the right destination.
