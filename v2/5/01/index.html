                A <strong>computer network</strong> refers to two or more computing devices connected together in order to share data and resources.
            </p>
    
            <p>Networks are grouped <b>based on their size</b>. There are <b>three types</b> of computer network.</p>

                A <strong>Local Area Network</strong> (LAN) covers a small geographical area located on a single site.
            </p>
    
            <p>
                LANs are often found in <b>homes</b>, <b>schools</b>, and <b>small businesses</b>.
                They can be wired, wireless, or a mix of both.
            </p>
    
            <p class="definition">
                <img src="../../icons/book.svg" class="icon" />
                A <strong>Wide Area Network</strong> (WAN) connects LANs in multiple geographical areas.
            </p>
    
            <p>
                WANs are sometimes used by <b>larger businesses</b> with multiple offices. The biggest WAN in the world
                is <b>the Internet</b>, which is mostly made up of undersea fibre-optic cables. WANs are <b>usually wired</b>.
            </p>
    
            <p>WANs are typically slower than LANs and can be more open to an external attack.</p>

                A <strong>Personal Area Network</strong> (PAN) is a very small network centred around a single user.
            </p>
    
            <p>
                An example of a PAN is the Bluetooth connection between a <b>mobile phone and some wireless headphones</b>.

                What are the advantages and disadvantages of using computer networks?
            </p>
    
            <p class="summary-question">
                <span class="answer">
                    Advantages: <br />
                    &bullet; Sharing files and resources (including devices like printers) across the network is a lot easier <br />
                    &bullet; It is therefore easier to work collaboratively <br />
                    &bullet; The computers can be centrally managed, so software can be updated remotely on all computers at once <br />
                    &bullet; Accounts can be stored centrally, so users can log in from any device on the network <br /> <br />
                    Disadvantages: <br />
                    &bullet; Networks are often very expensive to set up because a lot of hardware is required <br />
                    &bullet; Networks can be targeted by hackers, and malware can spread easily between devices on the same network <br />
                    &bullet; There is potential for a single point of failure, meaning the network could go down if something breaks
