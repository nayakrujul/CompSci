            <p>Despite their many advantages, networks can pose a security risk to organisations.</p>

            <p>
                Data can be <b>stolen or leaked</b> by either outsiders ("<b>hackers</b>") or insiders (in what's known as an
                "<b>insider attack</b>"). Organisations <b>must protect against this</b> because of legal requirements, and
                possible reputational damage.
            </p>

            <p>
                Multiple <b>security methods</b> can be used together in order to protect networks against these threats. <br />
                &nbsp;
            </p>

            <p class="definition">
                <img src="../../icons/book.svg" class="icon" />
                <strong>Authentication</strong> systems determine who you are and what you can access.
            </p>

            <p>Methods of authentication include:</p>

            <ul class="less-padding-left">
                <li>Username and password combinations</li>
                <li>Biometric authentication (like facial recognition)</li>
                <li>Physical access keys (like USB dongles)</li>
            </ul>

            <p>
                Once you have been authenticated, <b>user access levels</b> are used to determine what files, applications and
                resources you can access on the network. For example, some files on a school network might be only for
                teachers. User access levels would determine <b>who can access these files</b> and who should be restricted.
            </p>

            <p>To keep your passwords secure, you should:</p>

            <ul class="less-padding-left">
                <li>Use strong passwords (numbers, letters, and symbols; at least 8 characters long)</li>
                <li>Use a different password for each website</li>
                <li>Change your passwords regularly</li>
                <li>Never share your password with anyone</li>
                <li>Use a password manager</li>
            </ul>

            <p>
                To clear any confusion: hacking a password manager will <b>NOT</b> give you someone's passwords, as the
                passwords are encrypted. You will get the useless <b>ciphertext</b> version of their passwords. We'll learn more
                about encryption right now &darr; <br /> &nbsp;
            </p>

            <p class="definition">
                <img src="../../icons/book.svg" class="icon" />
                <strong>Encryption</strong> provides protection against data being read if it is stolen or intercepted.
            </p>

            <p>
                Encryption <b>cannot stop data from being stolen</b> or intercepted: it just makes the stolen data useless to the
                hacker.
            </p>

            <p>
                Encryption algorithms convert the original <b>plaintext</b> data into the encrypted <b>ciphertext</b> data.
                A password (called a "<b>key</b>") is needed to decrypt the ciphertext back into the plaintext.
            </p>

            <p>
                Unless a hacker also steals the key (which is pretty much impossible), they <b>can't decrypt the data</b>. <br />
                &nbsp;
            </p>

            <p class="definition">
                <img src="../../icons/book.svg" class="icon" />
                <strong>Firewalls</strong> are devices that act as barriers between the network and the outside world.
            </p>

            <p>
                They inspect both incoming and outgoing packets, and aim to <b>stop hackers and malware</b> getting into the
                network, as well as packets from spyware going out of the network.
            </p>

            <p>
                Note that firewalls can only <b>reduce the likelihood of unauthorised access</b> and that they do not directly
                protect against either the spread of malware within a network or the risk of downloading malware from
                external sources (like websites).
            </p>

            <p>This means that a firewall <b>will not prevent you from downloading a virus</b> from the Internet. <br /> &nbsp;</p>

            <p class="definition">
                <img src="../../icons/book.svg" class="icon" />
                <strong>MAC Address Filtering</strong> limits network access to only whitelisted devices.
            </p>

            <p>
                Each device has a unique <b>Media Access Control (MAC) address</b> on its Network Interface Card. The MAC
                addresses of <b>accepted devices are whitelisted</b> (allowlisted?) on the switch or Wireless Access Point. If a
                device has a MAC address which is not on the whitelist, it will be denied access to the network.
            </p>

            <p>
                However, it <b>does not identify who is using the device</b>: just because a device is authenticated doesn't mean
                the user of that device is trustworthy. Also you can <b>"spoof" (fake) a MAC address</b> to join a network.
            </p>

            <p class="question">
                <img src="../../icons/question.svg" class="icon" />
                What are the advantages and disadvantages of biometric authentication methods?
            </p>
    
            <p class="summary-question">
                <span class="answer">
                    Advantages: <br />
                    &bullet; It is impossible to forget your access credentials <br />
                    &bullet; Biometric authentication is often much faster than other methods <br />
                    &bullet; The access credentials cannot be (easily) stolen <br /> <br />
                    Disadvantages: <br />
                    &bullet; Biometric authentication often requires expensive hardware <br />
                    &bullet; There is a much higher rate of false positives in biometric authentication
