                    <span class="question">Define the term cyber security.</span>
                    <span class="rq-answer">The {processes / practices / technologies} designed to protect {networks / computers / programs / data}</span>

                    <span class="rq-answer">A penetration test can be carried out to identify potential weaknesses in the network's cyber security.</span>
                    <span class="rq-answer">The organisation can then use this information to patch or fix the weaknesses.</span>

                    <span class="question">State the difference between the two types of penetration test, and explain which one would be more useful to protect against an insider attack.</span>
                    <span class="rq-answer">In a black-box penetration test, the ethical hacker is not given any information about the network.</span>
                    <span class="rq-answer">In a white-box penetration test, the ethical hacker is given normal access to the network.</span>
                    <span class="rq-answer">Thus a white-box test would be carried out, because in an insider attack the insider knows about the network.</span>
                </div>

                    <span class="rq-answer">which can then spread through the network.</span>
                    <span class="rq-answer">They also allow users to steal data from the network.</span>
                </div>
                <div class="rq" marks="2">
