                A <strong>penetration test</strong> is an authorised attempt to gain access to a network without the normal means of access.
            </p>
    
            <p>
                Essentially, a penetration test is <b>conducted by an ethical ("white-hat") hacker</b> mimicking what an actual
                ("black-hat") hacker would do in order to get into the network. This is done <b>in order to test the security</b>
                of the network.
            </p>
    
            <p>
                Some penetration tests will <b>also test an organisation's staff</b> to see how likely they are to fall for social
                engineering (see <a href="../03/">6.03</a>) tricks.
            </p>
    
            <p><br />There are <b>two types</b> of penetration tests:</p>
    
            <p class="definition">
                <img src="../../icons/book.svg" class="icon" />
                In a <strong>black-box penetration test</strong>, the ethical hackers are given no information at all about the network.
            </p>
    
            <p>
                The objective is to see how much damage an <b>external hacker</b> could do to the network. The test initially
                involves looking for a way into the network.
            </p>
    
            <p class="definition">
                <img src="../../icons/book.svg" class="icon" />
                In a <strong>white-box penetration test</strong>, the ethical hackers are given some knowledge about the network.
            </p>
    
            <p>
                This could potentially include IP addresses or even login credentials. The objective is to see how much
                damage a <b>malicious insider</b> (someone already on the network) could do to the network.
            </p>

                <img src="../../icons/question.svg" class="icon" />
                Why should an organisation perform a penetration test?
            </p>
    
            <p class="summary-question">
                <span class="answer">
                    To avoid data breaches, test security controls, and ensure that the organisation isn't at risk of
                    breaking the law.
