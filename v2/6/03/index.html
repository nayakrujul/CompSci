                <strong>Social engineering</strong> is the art of manipulating people so that they divulge confidential information.
            </p>
    
            <p>
                Often, no matter how much is spent on sophisticated technical protection such as firewalls, it is <b>people
                who are the weak point</b>.
            </p>
    
            <p class="definition">
                <img src="../../icons/book.svg" class="icon" />
                <strong>Blagging</strong> (or pretexting) refers to using an invented scenario to increase the chances of the victim divulging information.
            </p>
    
            <p>
                This could include <b>impersonating an employee of a company</b>, posing as a delivery person, or pretending that
                they're in trouble and need money.
            </p>
    
            <p class="definition">

                <strong>Phishing</strong> is the technique of fraudulently obtaining private information, often via email or SMS.
            </p>
    
            <p>Phishing attacks will often <b>convince people to click on links</b> in order to obtain their personal details.</p>
    
            <p class="definition">
                <img src="../../icons/book.svg" class="icon" />
                <strong>Pharming</strong> means creating fake versions of websites where victims enter their details.
            </p>
    
            <p>
                This is the most common form of phishing attack. Many pharming attacks will use <b>fake versions of banks</b> or
                online shops like Amazon.
            </p>
    
            <p><br />Phishing attempts often contain a number of clues:</p>
    
            <ul class="less-padding-left">
                <li>They are typically addressed to <b>generic recipients</b> such as "Dear Sir/Madam" or "Dear user".</li>
                <li>They contain <b>links and threats</b> of consequences.</li>
                <li>There might be <b>spelling and grammar mistakes</b>.</li>
                <li>The sender's email address might <b>not be from an official domain</b>.</li>
            </ul>
    
            <p class="definition">
                <img src="../../icons/book.svg" class="icon" />
                <strong>Shouldering</strong> is the way of obtaining someone's private information (PIN, password, etc.) by looking while they enter it.
            </p>
    
            <p>
                Unlike other forms of social engineering, shouldering requires <b>close physical proximity</b> to the victim and
                can therefore not be carried out remotely.
            </p>
