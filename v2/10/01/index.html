                In the A Level exam you may be asked to <b>solve simple logic puzzles</b> like this one:
            </p>

            <p><br />
                A valuable jewel was taken from a museum by one of Alice, Bob or Carl. The following facts are gathered:
            </p>
            
            <ol class="less-padding-left">
                <li>Alice had an alibi after midnight, so she could only have stolen the jewel before midnight</li>
                <li>If and only if the thief used a rope, then Bob was in the storage room before the theft</li>
                <li>The jewel was stolen after midnight if and only if Carl was in the main hall before the theft</li>
                <li>Either Bob or Carl (but not both) was in the storage room before the theft</li>
                <li>If the thief used a crowbar, Bob is innocent</li>
                <li>Carl was either in the storage room or the main hall (but not both) before the theft</li>
                <li>The thief used either a crowbar or a rope (but not both)</li>
                <li>If Carl was not in the storage room before the theft then he is innocent</li>
                <li>If Carl was not in the main hall before the theft then Bob is the thief</li>
            </ol>

            <p>
                A useful trick in these kind of logic puzzles is to use the contrapositive: the statement "<b>if A then B</b>"
                (which we can write as "<b>A implies B</b>") is logically equivalent to "<b>if (not B) then (not A)</b>"
                (or "<b>B&prime; implies A&prime;</b>")
            </p>

                    &bullet; We start with clue 7 which tells us that either a crowbar or rope was used, but not both.
                    We examine the cases separately: <br /> <br />

                    Crowbar: <br />
                    &bullet; From clue 5, if a crowbar was used then Bob is innocent <br />
                    &bullet; Clue 2 tells us that Bob was not in the storage room before the theft in this case <br />
                    &bullet; Using clues 4 and 6, this means that if a crowbar was used then Carl was in the storage room before the theft <br />
                    &bullet; But from clue 9, Bob is the thief: we have reached a contradiction, therefore the thief did not use a crowbar <br /> <br />

                    Rope: <br />
                    &bullet; Using clue 2, if a rope was used then Bob was in the storage room before the theft <br />
                    &bullet; From clues 4 and 6, if the thief used a rope then Carl was in the main hall (and not in the storage room) <br />
                    &bullet; But from clue 8 this means that Carl is innocent <br />
                    &bullet; Clue 3 tells us that this means the jewel was stolen after midnight <br />
                    &bullet; Therefore from clue 1, Alice is innocent, and so Bob is the thief
