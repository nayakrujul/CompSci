                In the A Level exam you may be asked to <b>solve simple logic puzzles</b> like this one:
            </p>

            <p><br />
                A valuable jewel was taken from a museum by one of Alice, Bob or Carl. The following facts are gathered:
            </p>
            
            <ol class="less-padding-left">
                <li>The thief took the jewel out of the museum through the side exit</li>
                <li>If Bob was in the storage room before the theft, the jewel was taken using a backpack</li>
                <li>Either Bob or Carl was in the storage room before the theft occurred</li>
                <li>If Carl stole the jewel, Alice was not in the lobby</li>
                <li>If the jewel was put in a backpack, then Alice was in the lobby and did not steal the jewel</li>
            </ol>

                Who stole the jewel?
            </p>

                Because most of the clues use statements like <b>"If A, then B"</b> (which we can write as
                <b>"A implies B"</b> or <code>A &Implies; B</code>), we can use the <b>contrapositive</b> (<b>"not B
                implies not A"</b>, or <code>B&prime; &Implies; A&prime;</code>) which is <b>logically equivalent</b>
                to the original statement. For example, for clue 5, we can use "If the thief did <b>not</b> leave using
                the main exit, then Carl was <b>not</b> in the storage room before the theft".

            <p class="summary-question">
                <span class="answer">
                    &bullet; We know from clue 1 and the contrapositive of clue 5 that Carl was not in the storage room before the theft <br />
                    &bullet; We therefore know from clue 3 that Bob was in the storage room before the theft occurred <br />
                    &bullet; Now from clue 2, the jewel was taken using a backpack <br />
                    &bullet; From clue 5, we know that Alice was in the lobby and did not steal the jewel <br />
                    &bullet; Finally, from the contrapositive of clue 4, Carl did not steal the jewel. <br />
                    &bullet; The only remaining suspect is <b>Bob</b>, who must be the thief.
