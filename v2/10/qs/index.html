                        A company uses three servers: A, B and C. Each runs on a different operating system (Windows, macOS or Linux),
                        has a different role (web, database or authentication) and has a different maintenance day (Monday, Wednesday or Friday).
                        You are given that:
                    </span>
                    <ol class="spaced-out less-padding-left" style="display: inline-block; text-align: left;">
                        <li>Server A is maintained earlier in the week than the database server</li>
                        <li>The Windows server is not maintained on Wednesday, and does not do authentication</li>
                        <li>The authentication server is maintained two days before the web server</li>
                        <li>Server C is maintained two days after the Linux server</li>
                        <li>If the web server runs Linux, then it is maintained on Monday</li>
                    </ol>
                    <br />
                    <span class="question">Find the OS, role and maintenance day of each of the three servers.</span>
                    <span class="rq-answer">
                        From clue 3, we have two options: authentication server on Monday and web server on Wednesday,
                        or authentication server on Wednesday and web server on Friday. But for the second option, this
                        would force the database server to be maintained on Monday, which violates clue 1 (since nothing
                        is earlier than Monday). This means that the authentication server is Monday, the web server is
                        Wednesday, and the database server is Friday
                    </span>
                    <span class="rq-answer">
                        Since the Windows server does not do authentication and is not maintained on Wednesday (clue 2),
                        it must be the database server, maintained on Friday
                    </span>
                    <span class="rq-answer">
                        From the contrapositive of clue 5, the web server does not run Linux (since it is not maintained
                        on Monday). Since Windows is already taken, it must run macOS. Thus the authorisation server runs Linux.
                    </span>
                    <span class="rq-answer">
                        From clue 4, server C is maintained on Wednesday. This means it is the web server running macOS.
                        From clue 1, server A is maintained before the database server, so it must be maintained on
                        Monday. This means it is the authorisation server running Linux. By elimination, server B is the
                        remaining one: the database server running Windows, maintained on Friday
