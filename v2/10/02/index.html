                <strong>Abstraction</strong> is a process used in Computer Science where we remove details to focus on the important parts of a problem.
            </p>

            <p>There are <b>many different types</b> of abstraction, which we will cover on this page:</p>

            <br />

            <p class="definition">
                <img src="../../icons/book.svg" class="icon" />
                <strong>Representational abstraction</strong> is about removing unnecessary details of a problem.
            </p>

            <p>
                For example, if you were writing a program to find the <b>shortest route between two places</b>, you
                don't need details such as the names of specific buildings and parks, so you would <b>use
                representational abstraction</b> to just focus on the roads.
            </p>

            <p>
                <b>Information hiding</b> is a form of representational abstraction - other classes only need to know
                the <b>essential characteristics</b> of an object, and not any protected or private attributes.
            </p>

            <br />

            <p class="definition">
                <img src="../../icons/book.svg" class="icon" />
                <strong>Abstraction by generalisation</strong> is about grouping together objects with common characteristics.
            </p>

            <p>
                This allows us to <b>simplify problems</b>. An example of this is <b>inheritance in OOP</b>, where
                subclasses can use methods implemented in the parent class (so you don't need to write them twice).
            </p>

            <br />

            <p class="definition">
                <img src="../../icons/book.svg" class="icon" />
                <strong>Procedural abstraction</strong> is about using a general method (procedure) to complete a repeated task.
            </p>

            <p>
                For example, when making a game, you might write a <code><span class="other">drawText</span>(message)</code>
                procedure to <b>draw some text</b> (given in the parameter <code>message</code>) <b>on the screen</b>.
                Once you've written it, you can <b>forget about doing those exact steps again</b>, and instead just call
                the procedure.
            </p>

            <br />

            <p class="definition">
                <img src="../../icons/book.svg" class="icon" />
                <strong>Functional abstraction</strong> takes procedural abstraction one step further and hides the method of computation itself.
            </p>

            <p>
                Do you know how the square root (<code class="other">sqrt</code>) function actually works? (If you're interested, check out 
                <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methods_of_computing_square_roots" target="_blank">the Wikipedia article</a>.)
                This is an example of functional abstraction - <b>the user doesn't need to know how it works</b>, just <i>that</i> it works.
            </p>

            <br />

            <p class="definition">
                <img src="../../icons/book.svg" class="icon" />
                <strong>Data abstraction</strong> is about hiding the implementations of abstract data types.
            </p>

            <p>
                If a programming language has a <b>stack data type</b>, you <b>don't need to know how it's actually
                implemented</b> under the hood (similar to functional abstraction, just for data types).
            </p>

            <br />

            <p class="definition">
                <img src="../../icons/book.svg" class="icon" />
                <strong>Problem abstraction</strong> is about reducing the problem to one which you have already solved.
            </p>

            <p>
                For example, if you were writing a program to <b>find a route between two Tube stations</b>, you could
                <b>represent the map as a graph</b>, with stations being nodes and lines being edges. Then you could
                traverse the graph as usual to find a route.
            </p>

                <img src="../../icons/question.svg" class="icon" />
                How might abstraction be used when calling a weather API?
            </p>
    
            <p class="summary-question">
                <span class="answer">
                    Representational abstraction is used, because only the relevant details (temperature, wind, etc.)
                    are returned by the API, and not the raw data collected by weather balloons. Functional abstraction
                    is also used, because the user doesn't know how the forecast actually works.
