            <p>
                We've already seen that <b>bitmap</b> images are made of individual coloured pixels. The <b>colour depth</b>
                that image tells you how many bits are used for each pixel, and this determines how many colours can be
                stored in the image. We can also calculate the file size using <b>width</b> &times; <b>height</b> &times;
                <b>colour depth</b>.
            </p>

            <p>
                However, in GCSE, we did not mention the <b>header</b>. This is <b>metadata</b> at the start of the
                image which could include the height, width, and colour depth of the image.
            </p>

            <p class="definition">
                <img src="../../icons/book.svg" class="icon" />
                The <strong>resolution</strong> of an image (on a screen or paper) is the number of pixels per inch.
            </p>

            <p>With a higher resolution, the image will appear <b>smaller</b> but more relatively <b>detailed</b>.</p>

            <p><br />We are now going to learn about an <b>alternative way</b> of representing images:</p>

            <p class="definition">
                <img src="../../icons/book.svg" class="icon" />
                A <strong>vector</strong> image is made up of geometric shapes instead of pixels.
            </p>

            <p>
                This means that if you <b>draw shapes</b> such as rectangles, ellipses and other polygons, they can be
                represented exactly with <b>no pixelation</b> (you can <b>zoom in forever</b>).
            </p>

            <p>
                Vector image files store the <b>position, size, and colour</b> of each shape (essentially as a <b>list
                of shapes</b>). Then, the program which is displaying the image has to <b>draw each shape</b> one by one.
            </p>

            <p>
                The book icon next to all of the definitions is an SVG (scalable <b>vector</b> graphic). This means that
                if you <a href="../../icons/book.svg" target="_blank">open it in a new tab</a> and keep zooming in, the
                lines should still appear smooth.
            </p>

            <p><br />Table 1 shows a comparison of bitmap and vector images.</p>

            <p class="table">

                <img src="../../icons/question.svg" class="icon" />
                Would it make more sense for the images of characters in font faces to be stored as bitmaps or vectors?
            </p>
    
            <p class="summary-question">
                <span class="answer">
                    Vectors, because they are scalable (allowing the same images to be used for differently sized letters),
                    and because they typically take up less storage space.
