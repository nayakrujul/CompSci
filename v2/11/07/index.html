                Sometimes, data <b>can be corrupted</b> while stored or while being transferred. We need systems to find
                and correct the corrupted data.
            </p>

            <p class="definition">

                <strong>Majority voting</strong> is the simplest form of error checking and correction.
            </p>

            <p>
                If you send <b>three copies</b> of each bit, you will have either a <b>majority</b> of 0s or 1s. Just
                choose the majority for each bit. For example, if we receive <code class="string">1100</code>,
                <code class="string">1010</code> and <code class="string">1001</code>, we know the original sequence was
                <code class="string">1000</code>.
            </p>

            <p>
                With majority voting, we can <b>find and correct errors</b> in the data. However, we need <b>three times
                the space</b> to store the whole thing (e.g. a 20-bit sequence would need 60 bits in total with majority
                voting.)
            </p>

            <p class="definition">
                <img src="../../icons/book.svg" class="icon" />
                <strong>Parity bits</strong> can find errors but not correct them.
            </p>

            <p>
                Usually, one parity bit will be added to the end of a seven-bit sequence to make the <b>total number of
                1s even</b>. For example, the sequence <code class="string">1000101</code> will have the parity bit
                <code class="string">1</code> appended to it (because there were 3 zeroes before, and now there are 4).
            </p>

            <p>
                If we receive a sequence with an <b>odd number of 1s</b>, we know something has <b>gone wrong</b>.
                However, if we receive a sequence with and even number of 1s, we don't actually know that it's correct.
                In that case, the data may have an <b>even number of errors</b>. Usually, however, there aren't two or
                more errors in one byte of data.
            </p>

            <p>
                (Note: odd parity bits are very uncommon, but in that case the parity bit should make the total number
                of 1s odd).
            </p>

            <p>
                Although errors cannot be corrected with parity bits, they <b>take up a lot less space</b> than majority
                voting.
            </p>

                <strong>Check digits</strong> are basically parity bits for decimal numbers.
            </p>

            <p>
                For example, the last digit of a ISBN barcode number or credit card number is a check digit: it
                <b>verifies that the number has been entered correctly</b>.
            </p>

            <p class="definition">
                <img src="../../icons/book.svg" class="icon" />
                <strong>Checksums</strong> are similar to check digits, but larger than one digit.
            </p>

            <p>
                Just like with check digits, an <b>algorithm is applied</b> to the data to find a check number, the
                checksum. This can then be verified when entered.
            </p>

                If a system using majority voting received the sequences <code class="small-code string">00101101</code>,
                <code class="small-code string">01010011</code> and <code class="small-code string">11000100</code>, find
                the original sequence.
