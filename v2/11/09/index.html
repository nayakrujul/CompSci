                We have already learned about how sound waves can be <b>sampled at regular intervals</b> and stored in
                binary at GCSE, but now we will extend that knowledge on this page.
            </p>

            <p class="definition">

                The <strong>Nyquist-Shannon theorem</strong> states that the sample rate of an audio file must be at least twice the maximum frequency of the original sound wave to accurately reproduce it.
            </p>

            <p>
                Human hearing is <b>limited to around 20kHz</b>, so most audio files use a sampling rate of <b>44.1kHz</b>,
                which is slightly higher than the <b>minimum sample rate of 40kHz</b> required by the Nyquist-Shannon theorem.
            </p>

            <p><br />
                Everything you have learned about audio so far relates to <b>digital audio</b>, where sound is sampled
                and not stored accurately. However, there is an <b>alternative form of audio representation</b> that we
                will now learn about.
            </p>

                A <strong>Musical Instrument Digital Interface</strong> (MIDI) file stores instructions for how to play a piece of music instead of sampling the audio.
            </p>

            <p>
                Think of a MIDI file <b>like sheet music</b>: it can tell the computer <b>how</b> to play a piece of
                music instead of actually playing the piece of music.
            </p>

            <p>
                MIDI files contain <b>event messages</b>, which control the synthesiser that produces the sound. These
                event messages include information such as <b>which instrument</b> should play a note, <b>when</b> the 
                note should be played, the <b>pitch</b>, <b>volume</b>, and <b>duration</b> of a note, and <b>control
                data</b> like the BPM of the song.
            </p>

            <p class="question">
                <img src="../../icons/question.svg" class="icon" />
                What are the advantages and disadvantages of using MIDI files over digital audio files?
            </p>
    
            <p class="summary-question">
                <span class="answer">
                    MIDI files are easily editable: if you want to change just one note in the song you can just change
                    a single instruction; whereas with a digital audio file you would need to re-record the whole piece.
                    Also, the file sizes of MIDI files can be a lot smaller than their equivalents in digital audio.
                    <br /> <br />
                    However, with a MIDI file, the output audio depends entirely on the synthesiser being used to play
                    the music, so the song could sound vastly different on a different setup; whereas with a digital
                    audio file it will sound almost exactly the same on any setup.
