            <p>On this page we will learn about representing <b>negative integers</b> in binary.</p>

            <p>
                There are many methods for storing negative integers in binary, but the only one you need to know about
                is called <b>two's complement</b>.
            </p>

            <p class="definition">
                <img src="../../icons/book.svg" class="icon" />
                <strong>Two's complement</strong> is a method of representing signed (positive, negative, or zero) integers in binary.
            </p>

            <p>
                It uses the <b>most significant (left-most) bit to represent the sign</b>, with a 0 representing
                positive, and a 1 representing negative. The rest of the bits encode the magnitude of the number.
            </p>

            <p>
                All <b>non-negative integers</b> are represented <b>exactly like in unsigned binary systems</b>, except
                with a leading 0 for the sign. For example, the number 5 would be <code>0101</code> in a 4-bit signed system.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Note that because the left-most bit is being used for the sign, the <b>maximum value</b> that can be
                represented in a 4-bit signed system is <b>7</b> (<code>0111</code>).
            </p>

            <p><br />
                For <b>negative integers</b>, however, we follow a different process. Here's what it would look like for
                the number -5 in a 4-bit signed system.
            </p>

            <ul class="less-padding-left">
                <li>First, write the representation of +5, which is <code>0101</code>.</li>
                <li>Next, flip all of the bits: <code>1010</code>.</li>
                <li>Finally, add 1 to the binary representation to get <code>1011</code>.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Therefore, <b>-5 would be represented as <code>1011</code></b> in a 4-bit signed system.</p>

            <p>
                The <b>lowest value</b> that can be represented in a 4-bit signed system is <b>-8</b>. Remember that the
                <b>lower bound</b> will always be <b>even</b>, and the <b>upper bound</b> will always be <b>odd</b>.
            </p>

                <img src="../../icons/question.svg" class="icon" />
                How would the number -69 be represented in an 8-bit signed system?
            </p>
    
            <p class="summary-question">
                <span class="answer">
                    First, write the representation of +69, which is <code>0100 0101</code>.
                    Next, flip all the bits: <code>1011 1010</code>.
                    Finally, add 1 to the binary representation to get <code>1011 1011</code>.
                </span>
