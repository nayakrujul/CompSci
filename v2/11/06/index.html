                You should already be familiar with <b>standard form</b>, <code>m &times; 10<sup>x</sup></code>, where
                <code>m</code> is a multiplier between 1 and 10, and <code>x</code> is an integer exponent. Standard
                form is a <b>much more concise way</b> of writing very large and very small numbers.
            </p>

            <!-- <p>
                Also, <b>multiplication and division can be a lot easier</b> with standard form. For example, lets say a
                physicist wants to work out how far a beam of light travels in 2.5 milliseconds. That is, he wants to
                multiply the speed of light, 300000000 metres per seconds, by 0.0025 seconds.
            </p>

            <p>
                With standard form, <b>this task is astonishingly easy</b>. We need to do the calculation
                <code>(3 &times; 10<sup>8</sup>) &times; (2.5 &times; 10<sup>-3</sup>)</code>, which is clearly
                <code>7.5 &times; 10<sup>5</sup></code>.
            </p> -->

            <p>
                This conciseness is <b>the basis of Floating Point Representation</b>. However,
                because computers use binary, we use <b><code>m &times; 2<sup>x</sup></code></b> instead. Also, in AQA's
                version of Floating Point Representation, <code>m</code> is <b>between 0 and 1</b>, not 1 and 2.
                (Note that the IEEE 754 standard used in real life is different to what you need to learn.)

                <strong>Floating Point Representation</strong> is a different way of representing fractions in binary.
            </p>

            <p>
                In floating point, we have a <b>fractional mantissa</b> (multiplier) and an <b>integer exponent</b>
                (both signed). You will be given the lengths of both of these components if asked to convert a number to
                its floating-point representation.
            </p>

            <p><br />
                To <b>convert a number</b> to its floating-point representation, use the following steps. We'll take the
                example of 23.5, with an 8-bit mantissa and a 4-bit exponent. <br /> &nbsp;
            </p>

            <ul class="spaced-out less-padding-left">
                <li>
                    <b>Step 1</b>: Convert the number into fixed-point binary, using the same number of bits as the mantissa. <br /> <br />
                    <img src="./diagram.png" width="300px" />
                    <p>Note: because the mantissa is 8 bits long, we added an extra 0 at the end.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>Step 2</b>: Count the number of digits before the decimal point, excluding the sign bit.
                    <p>For our example of 23.5, the answer is 5. This is our exponent.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>Step 3</b>: Convert the exponent into signed binary.
                    <p>This will be <code>0101</code> for our example.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>Step 4</b>: remove the decimal point from the answer of Step 1.
                    <p>For us, this is <code>01011110</code>. This is the mantissa. We are now done.</p>
                </li>
            </ul>

            <p class="definition">
                <img src="../../icons/book.svg" class="icon" />
                <strong>Normalisation</strong> is the process of maximising the precision of values that can be represented in floating-point.
            </p>

            <p>
                We want to use the whole mantissa to make our value more precise, so we need to make sure the <b>first
                non-sign bit is significant</b>. This means that all mantissas should start with either <code>01</code>
                (for positive) or <code>10</code> (for negative).
            </p>

            <p><br />
                We can store a much larger range of numbers with floating point than fixed point, because we only care
                about <b>significant figures</b>, not decimal places. This is good because we don't really care about
                decimal places for extremely large numbers.

                <img src="../../icons/question.svg" class="icon" />
                Can 0.3 be stored exactly in binary?
            </p>
    
            <p class="summary-question">
                <span class="answer">
                    No - any fraction which doesn't have a power of 2 in the denominator is recurring in binary. Since
                    0.3 is 3/10, and 10 is not a power of two, it can never be stored exactly (it is <code>0.0100110011...</code>).
                    In the single-precision floating-point format, the closest value to 0.3 is <code>0.3000000119...</code>
