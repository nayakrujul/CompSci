                You should already be familiar with <b>standard form</b>, <code>m &times; 10<sup>x</sup></code>, where
                <code>m</code> is a multiplier between 1 and 10, and <code>x</code> is an integer exponent. Standard
                form is a <b>much more concise way</b> of writing very large and very small numbers.
            </p>

            <p>
                Also, <b>multiplication and division can be a lot easier</b> with standard form. For example, lets say a
                physicist wants to work out how far a beam of light travels in 2.5 milliseconds. That is, he wants to
                multiply the speed of light, 300 million metres per seconds, by 2.5 thousandths of a second.
            </p>

            <p>
                With standard form, <b>this task is astonishingly easy</b>. We need to do the calculation
                <code>(3 &times; 10<sup>8</sup>) &times; (2.5 &times; 10<sup>-3</sup>)</code>, which is clearly
                <code>7.5 &times; 10<sup>5</sup></code>.
            </p>

            <p>
                This conciseness and ease of calculations is <b>the basis of Floating Point Representation</b>. The only
                difference is that because computers use binary, we use <b><code>m &times; 2<sup>x</sup></code></b> instead.
            </p>

                <strong>Floating Point Representation</strong> is a more efficient way of representing fractions in binary.
            </p>

            <p>
                In a single-precision (32-bit) floating point number, we use 1 sign bit (+ or -), then 8 exponent bits
                (signed integer between -128 and +127), then 23 multiplier (mantissa) bits (fractional number between 1
                and 2). This allows us to represent <b>any number between <code>-2<sup>127</sup></code> and
                <code>+2<sup>127</sup></code></b> with around 8 significant figures of precision. This is so much more
                efficient than Fixed Point Representation!
            </p>

            <p>Diagram 1 shows the bits in a single-precision floating point number.</p>

            </p>

            <p>
                Note: this is beyond A Level, but a fun fact is that the mantissa actually stores a number between 0 and
                1, not 1 and 2. We can drop the leading 1 because it is always there, and then add 1 when multiplying.
                This allows us another bit of precision in the multiplier.
            </p>

            <p>
                The reason we're able to store such a large range of numbers is because with floating point we only care
                about <b>significant figures</b>, not decimal places. This is good because we don't really care about
                decimal places for extremely large numbers.
            </p>

            <p>
                Note that there is also a <b>double-precision format</b>, which uses 64 bits instead of 32. This gives
                around 16 significant figures of precision. This is the format that <b>most programming languages
                have</b> today.
            </p>

                <img src="../../icons/question.svg" class="icon" />
                Can 0.3 be stored exactly in binary?
            </p>
    
            <p class="summary-question">
                <span class="answer">
                    No - any fraction which doesn't have a power of 2 in the denominator is recurring in binary. Since
                    0.3 is 3/10, and 10 is not a power of two, it can never be stored exactly (it is <code>0.0100110011...</code>).
                    In the single-precision floating-point format, the closest value to 0.3 is <code>0.3000000119...</code>
