                <strong>Port numbers</strong> identify which application or process data is meant for.
            </p>

            <p>
                The allow multiple applications to <b>use the network at the same time</b> without confusion. The port
                is often written after the IP address, with a colon before (like <code>192.168.1.10:80</code> for port
                <code>80</code> on IP address <code>192.168.1.10</code>). The port number is 16 bits, so can be any
                number from <b>0 to 65535</b>. Together, the IP address and port number form a <b>socket</b>.
            </p>

            <p>
                TCP and UDP will attach the <b>source and destination port numbers</b> in the header. When your computer
                receives a packet, it checks the destination port number and <b>forwards it to the correct application</b>.
            </p>

            <p>
                There are three types of ports:
            </p>

            <ul class="less-padding-left spaced-out">
                <li>
                    Ports 0 to 1023 are <b>well-known ports</b>, assigned to common protocols (e.g. HTTP is 80, HTTPS is
                    443, FTP is 21, SSH is 22, SMTP is 25, and POP3 is 110). These are used on <b>application servers</b>
                    (like web servers) so that they only need to listen on one or two ports.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Ports 1024 to 49151 are <b>registered ports</b>, used by specific applications such as games.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Ports 49152 to 65535 are <b>dynamic ports</b>, temporarily assigned by the OS for outgoing connections.
                </li>
            </ul>

            <p>Diagram 1 shows an example communication between a client and web server.</p>

            </p>

            <br />

            <p>
                IP addresses consist of two parts: a <b>network ID</b> and <b>host ID</b>. Note that host IDs of all 0s
                and all 1s are reserved, so the maximum number of hosts is <code>2<sup>h</sup> - 2</code> where <code>h</code>
                is the number of bits in the host ID.
            </p>

            <p>
                A <b>subnet mask</b> is used to identify the two parts of an IP address. If the network ID is <code>n</code>
                bits, the subnet mask is <code>n</code> ones followed by <code>32 - n</code> zeroes. The subnet mask can
                be <code>AND</code>ed with the IP address to find the network ID. In the denary representation,
                <code>/n</code> is appended to the end of the IP address.
            </p>

            <p>Diagram 2 shows the two parts of an IP address.</p>

            </p>

            <p>
                If the network is particularly large, we might want to split the network into further <b>subnetworks</b>. 
                We can repurpose some bits from the start of the host ID to form the <b>subnet ID</b>. The subnet mask
                will include the bits of the subnet ID.
            </p>

            <p>
                IP addresses can be assigned either <b>statically</b> (you can manually enter an IP address) or
                <b>dynamically</b> (the device is <b>leased</b> an IP address for a fixed duration, after which it must
                adopt a new one). While static addresses are better for devices that need a known IP address like
                <b>routers and servers</b>, dynamic addresses can <b>reduce IP address conflicts</b> for other devices.
            </p>

            <p class="definition">
                <img src="../../icons/book.svg" class="icon" />
                The <strong>Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol</strong> (DHCP) is used to dynamically assign IP addresses to devices.
            </p>

            <p>
                The device requiring an IP address broadcasts a <code>DHCP<b class="no-underline">DISCOVER</b></code> to
                the network. The network's DHCP server (which is usually in the router) then responds with a
                <code>DHCP<b class="no-underline">OFFER</b></code>, which contains a free IP address. When the device
                receives the offer, it responds with a <code>DHCP<b class="no-underline">REQUEST</b></code>, asking for
                that IP address. Finally, the server sends a <code>DHCP<b class="no-underline">ACK</b></code>
                (acknowledgement) confirming that the IP address is now taken by that device.

                What network ID and host ID split would you use for a small business with up to 15 users?
            </p>
    
            <p class="summary-question">
                <span class="answer">
                    4 host ID bits allows for 14 devices, so this is not enough. The minimum number is 5 host ID bits (and so 27 network ID bits).
