                <strong>Malware</strong> is an umbrella term used to refer to a variety of forms of hostile or intrusive software.
            </p>

            <p>There are <b>many different forms</b> of malware</p>

            <p class="definition">
                <img src="../../icons/book.svg" class="icon" />
                A <strong>virus</strong> is a type of malware that is attached to another program or file, called a host. 
            </p>

            <p>
                Viruses can be <b>memory resident</b> (they can stay in memory even after the host has been closed) or
                <b>non-memory resident</b> (they only execute while the host is open).
            </p>

            <p class="definition">
                <img src="../../icons/book.svg" class="icon" />
                A <strong>worm</strong> is a type of malware that can replicate without user interaction.
            </p>

            <p>
                Worms often <b>spread throughout a network</b> by themselves, damaging or stealing data.
            </p>

            <p class="definition">
                <img src="../../icons/book.svg" class="icon" />
                A <strong>Trojan</strong> refers to malware disguised as legitimate software.
            </p>

            <p>
                They take their name from the story of the <b>Trojan War</b>, where Greek soldiers hid inside a wooden
                horse to enter the city of Troy.
            </p>

            <br />

            <p>
                Attackers can exploit <b>poor code quality</b> in a system (for example, utilising <b>buffer overflows</b>
                or <b>code injections</b>). Good <b>input validation</b> and regular <b>code testing</b> can help protect
                against malware.
            </p>

            <p>
                Another method used to protect against malware is <b>monitoring and protection</b>. Software such as
                <b>antivirus programs</b> can scan for known malware and remove them before they cause damage.
                <b>Regularly updating software</b> can also close security holes that could be exploited by malware.
            </p>

                    &bullet; Ransomware, which can make files unusable until the user pays the hacker <br />
