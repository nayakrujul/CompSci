                A <strong>protocol</strong> is a set of rules that defines how devices on a network communicate with each other.
            </p>

            <p>The protocols involved in sending data across networks can be grouped into <b>"layers"</b>.</p>

            <p>Table 1 shows the protocol layers.</p>

            <p>
                When data is being sent, it <b>starts at the application layer</b> and makes its way <b>down</b> to the link layer. When
                data is being received, it <b>starts at the link layer</b> and makes its way <b>up</b> to the application layer.
            </p>

            <p>
                Each protocol will add its own <b>header</b> to the payload that it receives. This means that the final
                packet of data will look something like this:
            </p>

            <p>Diagram 1 shows the structure of a packet of data.</p>

            <p><br />We will now look at each protocol in detail. <br /> &nbsp;</p>

            <p class="definition">
                <img src="../../icons/book.svg" class="icon" />
                The <strong>HyperText Transfer Protocol</strong> (HTTP) is used to transfer webpages between a client (web browser) and web server.
            </p>

            <p>
                The client sends a <b>request</b> (e.g. <code>GET</code> or <code>POST</code>) and the web server sends
                a <b>response</b> containing the status code and content of the webpage. Everything is sent in plaintext,
                with <b>no encryption</b>.
            </p>

            <p>
                The <b>HyperText Transfer Protocol Secure</b> (HTTPS) encrypts the request and response using
                <b>Transport Layer Security</b> (TLS). This makes it <b>more secure</b> and less prone to hacking.
            </p>

            <p class="definition">
                <img src="../../icons/book.svg" class="icon" />
                The <strong>File Transfer Protocol</strong> (FTP) is used to transfer files between a client and server.
            </p>

            <p>
                Servers can <b>accept connections from multiple clients</b> simultaneously and limit file access to
                authenticated users or provide anonymous access to any connected user. It is unencrypted by default,
                but the <b>File Transfer Protocol Secure</b> (FTPS) extension works similarly to HTTPS, encrypting
                communications using TLS.
            </p>

            <p class="definition">
                <img src="../../icons/book.svg" class="icon" />
                The <strong>Simple Mail Transfer Protocol</strong> (SMTP) sends emails from a client to a mail server, or between mail servers.
            </p>

            <p>
                It is a <b>push protocol</b>: it can only send and not receive emails. When an email is sent, SMTP
                passes the message to a <b>mail server</b>. The message can then be sent <b>around other mail servers</b>
                until it reaches the recipient's server, at which point it can be <b>retrieved using IMAP or POP3</b>.
            </p>

            <p class="definition">
                <img src="../../icons/book.svg" class="icon" />
                The <strong>Post Office Protocol v3</strong> (POP3) retrieves emails from a mail server to a client.
            </p>

            <p>
                It <b>downloads incoming emails</b> to a local device, then <b>deletes them</b> from the server. This
                allows users to read emails afterwards <b>even if they are offline</b>.
            </p>

            <p class="definition">
                <img src="../../icons/book.svg" class="icon" />
                The <strong>Secure Shell</strong> (SSH) protocol allows users to securely connect to and manage remote systems.
            </p>

            <p>
                It <b>encrypts all data</b> between the client and server, and also performs <b>authentication</b>. SSH
                is commonly used by network administrators.
            </p>

            <br />

            <p class="definition">
                <img src="../../icons/book.svg" class="icon" />
                The <strong>Transmission Control Protocol</strong> (TCP) provides reliable, ordered delivery of packets.
            </p>

            <p>
                It first <b>establishes a connection</b> with the receiving device. Then, it <b>splits the data</b> into
                numbered packets. When the packets arrive at the destination, the receiving device <b>sends an
                acknowledgement</b>. Any packets that did not arrive are re-sent. At the other end, the packets are
                <b>reassembled in order</b>.
            </p>

            <p class="definition">
                <img src="../../icons/book.svg" class="icon" />
                The <strong>User Datagram Protocol</strong> (UDP) sends data quickly without guaranteeing delivery.
            </p>

            <p>
                Each packet is <b>sent independently</b>. There is no ordering or acknowledgement. This is useful in
                cases where <b>speed is more important than reliability</b>, for example livestreaming or gaming.
            </p>

            <br />

            <p class="definition">
                <img src="../../icons/book.svg" class="icon" />
                The <strong>Internet Protocol</strong> (IP) handles the routing of packets.
            </p>

            <p>
                Each network device is assigned a unique <b>IP address</b>. When a packet of data is to be transmitted,
                a <b>header</b> is attached, containing the IP addresses of the source and destination devices, a
                checksum and a <b>time to live</b> (TTL) value, which is decremented at each step. If the TTL value
                reaches 0, <b>the packet is discarded</b> (this is to prevent infinite cycles).
            </p>

            <p>There are two standards of IP addresses:</p>

            <ul class="less-padding-left">
                <li>
                    <b>IPv4</b>: a <b>32-bit number</b> that is usually written in denary as four <code>0-255</code>
                    numbers separated by dots, like <code>192.168.0.1</code>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>IPv6</b>: a <b>128-bit number</b> that is usually written in hexadecimal as eight <code>0-ffff</code>
                    numbers separated by colons, like <code>2001:db8:0:0:0:8a2e:370:7334</code>
                </li>
            </ul>

            <p>
                IPv4 only allows for a maximum of <code>2<sup>32</sup></code> (about 4.3 billion) addresses, while IPv6
                allows for <code>2<sup>128</sup></code> (340 undecillion, which is 340 billion billion billion billion)
                addresses.
            </p>

            <p>We will learn more about IP addresses on the next page.</p>

                <strong>Wi-Fi</strong> is a family of related protocols which handle the physical transmission of data as radio waves.
            </p>

            <p>
                It uses <b>two radio frequency bands</b>: 2.4GHz (which has a greater range and is better at getting through walls)
                and 5GHz (which is faster over shorter distances). <br /> &nbsp;
            </p>

                <img src="../../icons/book.svg" class="icon" />
                <strong>Ethernet</strong> is a family of related protocols which handle the physical transmission of data as electrical currents.
            </p>

            <p>
                While Wi-Fi is specifically for wireless connections, Ethernet is specifically for <b>wired connections</b>.
            </p>

            <p>
                Each device's Network Interface Card (NIC) has a unique <b>Media Access Control (MAC) address</b>.
                Ethernet uses MAC addresses to route packets between different network interfaces <b>on a local area
                network</b>, while IP uses IP addresses to route data between networks.
