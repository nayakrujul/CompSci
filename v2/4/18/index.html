                <strong>Cloud Storage</strong> is a service where files can be uploaded via the Internet to a remote server.
            </p>
    
            <p>The data is then stored on HDDs and SSDs in data centres all around the world.</p>
    
            <p><br />The <b>advantages</b> of Cloud Storage include:</p>
    
            <ul class="spaced-out less-padding-left">
                <li>
                    Files and applications <b>can be accessed from any Internet-connected device</b> anywhere in the world.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Files stored in the cloud <b>can be shared easily</b>, often by just sending someone a link to the file.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>Working with other people is easier</b> when the files are stored in the Cloud.
                </li>
                <li>
                    There is <b>no need to buy potentially expensive hardware</b> to store the data yourself.
                </li>
                <li>
                    There is <b>no need for a company to hire IT staff</b> to manage the hardware.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>Security and backup is managed by the host company</b> so you don't need to worry about it.
                </li>
            </ul>
    
            <p><br />The <b>disadvantages</b> of Cloud Storage include:</p>

                <li>
                    An <b>Internet connection is required</b> to access the files.
                </li>
                <li>
                    You are <b>dependent on the host company</b> to manage the security and backup of your files properly.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Cloud data <b>could be targeted by hackers</b> more easily than locally-stored data.
                </li>
                <li>
                    It is <b>unclear who legally owns the data</b> that is stored on the cloud.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Ongoing <b>subscription fees</b> may become expensive in the long term.

                Would it be wise for classified documents to be stored on the Cloud?
            </p>
    
            <p class="summary-question">
                <span class="answer">
                    No: Cloud Storage servers are often targeted by hackers, and it may be unclear who legally owns the
                    data, which is not good for classified documents.
