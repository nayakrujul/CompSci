                The <strong>Central Processing Unit</strong> (CPU) processes all of the data and instructions that make the computer system work.
            </p>
    
            <p>The CPU has five main components:</p>
    
            <ul class="spaced-out less-padding-left">
                <li>
                    The <b>Control Unit</b> (CU) <br />
                    The CU <b>coordinates all the activities</b> taking place inside the CPU. Its main job is to manage the
                    Fetch-Execute cycle which will be explored on the next page.
                </li>
    
                <li>
                    The <b>Arithmetic and Logic Unit</b> (ALU) <br />
                    The ALU <b>carries out all the calculations</b>. This includes addition and subtraction, binary shifts, logical
                    comparisons like greater than and less than, and boolean operations like AND, OR, NOT, and XOR.
                </li>
    
                <li>
                    The <b>Clock</b> <br />
                    The clock is located inside the CU. Its job is to <b>synchronise the actions</b> of the CPU. It sends out a
                    signal at a constant rate. The number of clock cycles (or "ticks") per second is called the clock speed.
                </li>
    
                <li>
                    The <b>Buses</b> <br />
                    The buses are a collection of wire that are used to <b>transmit data between the components</b> of the CPU, and
                    to other parts of the computer system.
                </li>
    
                <li>
                    The <b>Cache and Registers</b> <br />
                    The registers <b>hold a small amount of data</b> which is needed by the CPU. They are the quickest form of
                    memory to read from and write to. The cache is memory which is slower than the registers, but faster
                    than RAM. It stores regularly used data so that the CPU can access it quickly the next time it's needed.
                </li>
            </ul>

            <br />

            <p class="question">
                <img src="../../icons/question.svg" class="icon" />
                Why isn't all of a computer's data stored in cache?
            </p>
    
            <p class="summary-question">
                <span class="answer">
                    Cache is volatile, so it loses its contents when the power is turned off. Cache is also very expensive,
                    so it would not be practical to use a lot of it.
