                <strong>Solid State Drives</strong> (SSDs) are the main form of flash storage in computers.
            </p>
    
            <p>They use <b>electrical currents</b> to represent 1s and 0s.</p>
    
            <p><br />
                SSDs have <b>significantly faster read/write times</b> than HDDs. They are also more robust because they
                have <b>no moving parts</b>.
            </p>
    
            <p>However, SSDs are <b>more expensive</b> than HDDs (&approx;10p per GB), and they have a slightly lower capacity.</p>
    
            <p>
                Also, flash storage degrades over time, as it only has a <b>limited number of read/write cycles</b>, meaning that
                SSDs are less reliable than HDDs.
            </p>
    
            <p><br />Other types of flash storage include USB sticks and SD cards.</p>

            <p class="question">
                <img src="../../icons/question.svg" class="icon" />
                Would an SSD need defragmentation?
            </p>
    
            <p class="summary-question">
                <span class="answer">
                    No, because it takes the same amount of time to read from or write to any memory location on an SSD.
                    HDDs need defragmentation because of the spinning disks: data in adjacent sectors can be read more
                    quickly than data in far away sectors.
                </span>
