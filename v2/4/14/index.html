                <strong>Secondary Storage</strong> is non-volatile storage which isn't directly accessible by the CPU.
            </p>
    
            <p>
                There are three forms of secondary storage: <b>magnetic</b>, <b>flash</b>, and <b>optical</b>, all of which will be
                covered over the next three pages.
            </p>

                <strong>Hard Disk Drives</strong> (HDDs) are the main form of magnetic storage in computers.
            </p>
    
            <p>
                They are made up of magnetised metal disks, called <b>"platters"</b>, spinning at a rate of around 10,000
                revolutions per minute.
            </p>
    
            <p>
                Binary data is represented by the <b>direction of magnetisation</b> (North is 1 and South is 0).
            </p>
    
            <p>Each platter is divided into <b>"tracks"</b>, and each track into <b>"sectors"</b>.</p>
    
            <p>There is a <b>read/write head</b>, like the needle on an old record player.</p>

            <p class="question">
                <img src="../../icons/question.svg" class="icon" />
                What are the advantages and disadvantages of using HDDs?
            </p>
    
            <p class="summary-question">
                <span class="answer">
                    HDDs offer very large storage capacities (several terabytes), and are also very cheap (&lt;5p per GB).
                    However, because of their moving parts, HDDs can be damaged by large impacts like drops.
