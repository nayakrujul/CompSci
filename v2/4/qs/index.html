                    <span class="rq-answer">Application software is designed to help the user perform specific end-user tasks</span>
                    <span class="rq-answer">System software is run by the system to help control or maintain the computer</span>

                    <span class="question">Explain two benefits of embedded systems over general-purpose systems.</span>
                    <span class="rq-answer">They are cheaper to produce</span>
                    <span class="rq-answer">Because most of their memory is ROM, which is cheaper than RAM</span>
                    <span class="rq-answer">They are more reliable</span>
                    <span class="rq-answer">Because they have less code, and so usually have less bugs</span>
                    <span class="rq-answer">They are more energy-efficient</span>
                    <span class="rq-answer">Because they don't need to perform as many tasks</span>

                    <span class="question">Explain how cache memory is used by the CPU.</span>
                    <span class="rq-answer">Cache stores regularly used data and instructions</span>
                    <span class="rq-answer">which can be accessed by the CPU faster than from RAM</span>

                    <span class="question">Describe what happens in each stage of the Fetch-Decode-Execute Cycle.</span>
                    <span class="rq-answer"><i>[Fetch]</i> The next instruction is retrieved from main memory</span>
                    <span class="rq-answer"><i>[Fetch]</i> and placed into the Instruction Register in the CPU</span>
                    <span class="rq-answer"><i>[Fetch]</i> The Program Counter register is incremented</span>
                    <span class="rq-answer"><i>[Decode]</i> The CPU splits the instruction up</span>
                    <span class="rq-answer"><i>[Decode]</i> and works out what needs to be done</span>
                    <span class="rq-answer"><i>[Execute]</i> The instruction is carried out by the CPU</span>
                    <span class="rq-answer"><i>[Execute]</i> Main memory may be updated in the process</span>
                    <span class="rq-answer"><i>[Execute]</i> Data may be sent to and from the ALU in order to carry out the instruction</span>

                    <span class="question">Compare and explain the RAM and ROM requirements in an embedded system and a general-purpose system.</span>
                    <span class="rq-answer">In an embedded system there is more ROM than RAM</span>
                    <span class="rq-answer">because the software does not need to be changed (it is hard-coded)</span>
                    <span class="rq-answer">In a general-purpose system there is more RAM than ROM</span>
                    <span class="rq-answer">because the software is replaceable and is thus programs are run from RAM</span>
