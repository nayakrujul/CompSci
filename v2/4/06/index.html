                <strong>Hardware</strong> is the physical components of a computer system.
            </p>
    
            <p>This includes the <b>screen</b>, <b>CPU</b>, <b>RAM</b>, and <b>keyboard</b>.</p>

                <strong>Software</strong> refers to the programs or instructions that control a computer's hardware.
            </p>
    
            <p>There are two types of software.</p>

                <strong>Application software</strong> means programs which perform end-user tasks.
            </p>
    
            <p>This includes <b id="js-target">a browser</b>, <b>Microsoft Word</b>, and <b>the Calculator app</b>.</p>

                <strong>System software</strong> means programs which are needed for the computer to function.
            </p>
    
            <p>
                This includes <b>the Operating System</b>, <b>utility software</b>, and <b>programming language
                translators</b>. We already learned about translators in Section 2, and we will learn about the OS and
                utility software later in this section.

                A <strong>general purpose system</strong> is a computer system which can perform many tasks and has replaceable software.
            </p>
    
            <p>For example, <b>the device that you're viewing this page on</b> (or any other phone, tablet, laptop or desktop).</p>

                An <strong>embedded system</strong> is a computer system which is built into another device to perform a specific task.
            </p>
    
            <p>
                There are embedded systems in <b>washing machines</b>, <b>dishwashers</b> and <b>microwaves</b>.
                Embedded systems have their software (called <b>"firmware"</b>) hard-coded onto their chip, so their
                <b>instructions cannot be changed</b>.
            </p>

            <p class="question">
                <img src="../../icons/question.svg" class="icon" />
                What are the advantages and disadvantages of embedded systems?
            </p>
    
            <p class="summary-question">
                <span class="answer">
                    Embedded systems are very reliable, cheap to mass produce, and energy efficient. However, they are
                    difficult to update if a bug is discovered.
