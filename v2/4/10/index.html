                The <strong>Fetch-Execute Cycle</strong> (sometimes called the Fetch-Decode-Execute Cycle) describes how a CPU carries out instructions.
            </p>
    
            <p>The cycle consists of three stages:</p>
    
            <ul class="spaced-out less-padding-left">
                <li>
                    The <b>Fetch</b> Stage <br />
                    The next instruction is <b>loaded from main memory</b> into the Instruction Register in the CPU. The Program
                    Counter (the register that stores what memory address the next instruction is at) is incremented to
                    point to the next instruction. 
                </li>
    
                <li>
                    The <b>Decode</b> Stage <br />
                    The CPU <b>works out what needs to be done</b> in order to carry out the instruction.
                </li>
    
                <li>
                    The <b>Execute</b> Stage <br />
                    The operation is <b>carried out by the CPU</b>. If necessary, data is sent between the CU and the ALU. Data may
                    be written to or read from main memory. Any relevant registers are updated.
                </li>
            </ul>
    
            <p><br />Then, <b>the cycle starts again</b>. Each stage takes one* clock tick.</p>

            <p>
                Note: it is better <b>not to use the words "Fetch", "Decode", or "Execute"</b> if you are asked to
                describe the stages of the cycle in an exam. Instead, use synonyms like in the description above.
            </p>

            <p><sub>
                *In reality, stages of the cycle can take more than one clock tick, but it will always be a whole number
                of ticks. However, for GCSE, you will need to write that each stage takes exactly one clock tick.
            </sub></p>

            <p class="question">
                <img src="../../icons/question.svg" class="icon" />
                How will the clock speed of a CPU affect its performance?
            </p>
    
            <p class="summary-question">
                <span class="answer">
                    If the clock speed is higher, the Fetch-Execute Cycle takes less time and therefore the CPU performs
                    better. However, increasing the clock speed above the recommended level is called "overclocking" -
                    which could be dangerous for your computer.
