                The <strong>clock speed</strong> of a CPU is the number of pulses sent out by the clock every second.
            </p>
    
            <p>
                It is typically measured <b>in gigahertz (GHz)</b>. 1GHz is 1 billion cycles per second. Most CPUs
                nowadays have clock speeds <b>between 3 and 5 GHz</b>.
            </p>
    
            <p>
                If the clock speed is higher, the <b>Fetch-Execute Cycle takes less time</b> and therefore the CPU
                performs better.

                <strong>CPU cores</strong> have their own CU, ALU and cache.
            </p>
    
            <p>
                Most CPUs have <b>multiple cores</b> (usually between 8 and 16), meaning they can process multiple
                instructions <b>in parallel</b>. However, this is only useful if there are multiple tasks running on
                your computer.

                <strong>Cache</strong> memory is very fast memory located within the CPU.
            </p>
    
            <p>
                Having more cache memory <b>reduces the time</b> it takes for the CPU to retrieve data and instructions,
                therefore making the CPU perform better. However, <b>cache is very expensive</b>.

            <p class="question">
                <img src="../../icons/question.svg" class="icon" />
                Roughly how many times more RAM than cache do you think a typical computer has?
            </p>
    
            <p class="summary-question">
                <span class="answer">
                    A typical computer will have around 16GB of RAM, and around 100MB of cache overall. Note that 16GB
                    is equal to 16000MB, so the answer is about 160 times more.
