            <p>This page contains details about the AQA GCSE and A Level Computer Science examinations. <br /> &nbsp;</p>
            <h1>GCSE (8525)</h1>
            <p><a href="https://www.aqa.org.uk/subjects/computer-science-and-it/gcse/computer-science-8525" target="_blank">AQA Website</a></p>
            <p>
                The GCSE part of this revision guide follows the AQA specification's chapters exactly.
                Section 1 in this revision guide is AQA's Section 3.1, Section 2 is Section 3.2, etc.
            </p>
            <h2>Paper 1 ("Computational Thinking and Programming Skills")</h2>
            <p>This paper is a 90 marks, 120 minutes written paper. Calculators are prohibited.</p>
            <p>
                In Paper 1 you will be assessed on long-form programming questions in your chosen language
                (Python, C# or VB), short-form programming questions in pseudocode, and questions on the theory of
                programming (Sections 1 and 2 in the revision guide), such as structured programming.
            </p>
            <h2>Paper 2 ("Computing Concepts")</h2>
            <p>This paper is a 90 marks, 105 minutes written paper. Calculators are prohibited.</p>
            <p>
                In Paper 2 you will be assessed on Sections 3 to 8, which may include SQL programming questions, but not
                pseudocode or Python/C#/VB. You will most likely have to write a 9-mark answer on Section 8 (Impacts of
                Computing). <br /> &nbsp;
            </p>
            <h1>A Level (7517)</h1>
            <p><a href="https://www.aqa.org.uk/subjects/computer-science-and-it/as-and-a-level/computer-science-7516-7517" target="_blank">AQA Website</a></p>
            <p>
                The A Level part of this revision guide does not exactly follow the AQA specification's chapters.
                Sections 9-10 in this revision guide correspond to AQA's Sections 10-13, and Sections 12-20
                correspond to AQA's Sections 14-22. AQA's Section 23 (the NEA) is not covered in this revision guide.
            </p>
            <h2>Paper 1</h2>
            <p>This paper is a 100 marks, 150 minutes on-screen exam. Calculators are prohibited.</p>
            <p>
                A Level Paper 1 is basically the same as GCSE Paper 1, except that it is slightly harder (with some
                additional theory of programming content from Sections 9-11) and is done on a computer. 
            </p>
            <h2>Paper 2</h2>
            <p>This paper is a 100 marks, 150 minutes written exam. Calculators are allowed.</p>
            <p>
                A Level Paper 2 is basically the same as GCSE Paper 2, but there is some additional content in Sections
                12-20. No programming is required in this paper, except SQL in Section 19.
            </p>
            <h2>Non-Exam Assessment (NEA)</h2>
            <p>This is a 75 marks practical component.</p>
            <p>
                You will be expected to create your own project for the A Level exam. The NEA is not covered in this
                revision guide. For more information, see the AQA website, linked above.
