                A <strong>tractable</strong> problem is one that can be solved in polynomial time or better.
            </p>

            <p>
                Polynomial time is an umbrella term for <b>any time complexity of the form <code>O(n<sup>k</sup>)</code></b>.
                It includes <b>quadratic time</b> (<code>O(n<sup>2</sup>)</code>), <b>cubic time</b>
                (<code>O(n<sup>3</sup>)</code>), and so on.
            </p>

            <p>
                The problems solved by <b>Examples 1 to 4</b> on the previous page <b>are tractable</b> (because
                <b>constant time</b>, <b>logarithmic time</b> and <b>linear time</b> are all considered <b>"better" than
                polynomial time</b>). <b>Searching and sorting algorithms</b> (<a href="../06/">16.06</a>) are also
                tractable.
            </p>

                An <strong>intractable</strong> problem is one that cannot be solved in polynomial time or better.
            </p>

            <p>
                <b>Example 5</b> on the previous page is <b>intractable</b>, as exponential time is <b>worse than
                polynomial time</b>. Intractable problems <b>cannot be solved efficiently</b> for larger inputs.
            </p>

            <p><br />However, there are also problems which cannot be solved using algorithms at all.</p>

            <p class="definition">
                <img src="../../icons/book.svg" class="icon" />
                A <strong>non-computable</strong> problem is one with no algorithmic solution.
            </p>

            <p>
                For example: the <b>halting problem</b>. Given <b>any program as an input</b>, the machine must output
                whether that program will <b>halt</b> (finish execution) or <b>loop forever</b>.
            </p>

            <p>
                This was <b>proven to be impossible</b> by Alan Turing in 1936, showing that there are some problems
                which <b>cannot be solved by a computer</b>.

            <p class="question">
                <img src="../../icons/question.svg" class="icon" />
                What is the time complexity of an algorithm to find all permutations of an array? Is this problem tractable or intractable?
            </p>
    
            <p class="summary-question">
                <span class="answer">
                    The time complexity is <code>O(n!)</code>, so it runs in "factorial time" (which is even worse than
                    exponential time). This is clearly an intractable problem.
