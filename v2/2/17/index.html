                <strong>Translators</strong> are a type of software which translate (convert) code into machine code that the computer can run.
            </p>

            <p>
                There are three types of translator: <b>compilers, interpreters, and assemblers</b>. <br />
                Compilers and interpreters work on high-level languages. Assemblers work on assembly language.
            </p>

            <p><br />Table 1 shows the differences between compilers and interpreters.</p>

                <b>Note:</b> interpreters don't translate directly into machine code &mdash;
                instead, they take each instruction in the code and call machine code
                subroutines within their own code to carry out that instruction.

                    - Customers will not need to have the translator installed on their computer <br />
                    - Other people will not be able to see and copy the source code <br />
                    - The program will execute faster as it is in machine code
