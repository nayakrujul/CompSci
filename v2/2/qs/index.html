                    <span class="rq-answer">Low-level languages have more control over the hardware</span>
                    <span class="rq-answer">so e.g., the programmer can control exactly how memory is used in the program</span>
                    <span class="rq-answer">Very efficient code can be written for a particular type of processor</span>
                    <span class="rq-answer">so programs in low-level languages generally execute faster and use less memory than programs in high-level languages</span>
                    <span class="rq-answer">Commands in machine code can be executed directly by the computer</span>
                    <span class="rq-answer">so a translator is not required</span>

                    <span class="rq-answer">It calls machine code subroutines to carry out commands</span>
                    <span class="rq-answer">The interpreter stops if it finds a runtime error</span>
                    <span class="rq-answer">No machine code is outputted by the interpreter so the program needs to be translated each time it is executed</span>
