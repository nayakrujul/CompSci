                <strong>Association</strong> is another fundamental principle of OOP where objects can reference other objects.
            </p>

            <p>
                For example, a <code class="other">Character</code> object in a game might have references to the
                <code class="other">Weapon</code>s that it can use. It <b>does not make sense to use inheritance</b>
                here, since the two objects are not the same type as each other: instead they are <b>linked by ownership</b>.
            </p>

            <p><br />There are <b>two types of association</b>, differentiated by the strength of the relationship:</p>

            <p class="definition">
                <img src="../../icons/book.svg" class="icon" />
                <strong>Composition</strong> is the stronger form of association, where the contained objects cannot exist without the container.
            </p>

            <p>
                For example: <code class="other">Attachment</code> and <code class="other">Email</code>. An
                <code class="other">Email</code> object will keep track of the <code class="other">Attachment</code>s to
                that email, but <b>the attachments cannot exist if the email is deleted</b>. Therefore this is composition.
            </p>

            <p class="definition">
                <img src="../../icons/book.svg" class="icon" />
                <strong>Aggregation</strong> is the weaker form of association, where the contained objects may exist outside of the container.
            </p>

            <p>
                For example: <code class="other">Song</code> and <code class="other">Playlist</code>. A
                <code class="other">Playlist</code> object will keep track of the <code class="other">Songs</code>s in
                that playlist, but <b>the songs can still exist if the playlist is deleted</b>. Therefore this is aggregation.
            </p>

                <img src="../../icons/question.svg" class="icon" />
                If you have a choice, which should you choose: composition or inheritance?
            </p>
    
            <p class="summary-question">
                <span class="answer">
                    Composition should be favoured over inheritance. It allows relationships to be more flexible,
                    therefore making code easier to maintain and extend.
